    <h4>Toxic beauty standard</h4>
    <p>Skin lightening, also known as whitening or bleaching, is a billion-dollar industry with products that thousands of people have been using throughout the century. However, these whitening products can lead to severe damage to the skin. Those who promote or use skin whitening products are only further conveying a toxic view revolving around beauty and social value. For centuries now, society has fallen into toxic beauty standards with pale skin being one of the highest forms of beauty one could have. Beyond just cosmetics, we can see this every day in regard to racism itself and the existence of white privilege. White skin was once and in some cases still seen as the most superior beauty standard to have in society. It began in the sixteenth century when having fair skin was an indicator of having a higher social status than most since fair skin didn't appear ‘dirty’ or ‘poor’. Due to this, the existence of white privilege slowly began to appear. People of whiter skin tones tend to be treated nicer or have more opportunities laid out for them because of the good personal qualities attributed to the color of their skin. However, this only promotes a sense of inequality, especially to those who do not have white skin tones. </p>
    <p>Aspiring to have whiter skin to fit into an unrealistic societal standard is an unhealthy way to view oneself regardless of skin tone. A study led by Dr. Roopal Kundu, founder and director of the Northwestern Medicine Center for Ethnic Skin and Hair reports that respondents of her study experienced colorism in their lives. Colorism is a system revolving around inequality in which those with lighter skin are deemed as more beautiful and socially acceptable than any other skin color. She talks about the experience of black men wherein black men with lighter skin tones are perceived to have more education compared to those with darker skin tones. It is also seen time and time again that black people face harsher prison sentences than people with lighter skin according to research conducted by the University of Chicago. Due to the sheer amount of racial prejudice these people face, more and more people of color began to bleach their skin with these skin whitening products. A study led by the World Health Organization concluded that a staggering 40% of African women bleach their skin–77% in Nigeria to 59% in Togo, 35% in South Africa, and 25% in Mali which led to a number of health issues in regards to their skin.</p>
    <p> Moreover, Black Lives Matter wouldn't be a thing if colorism wasn't such a prevalent issue, it wouldn't be something that people of color all around the world are still fighting for if white skin being the highest standardized form of beauty wasn't something that unfortunately still applies today. Overall, skin-whitening products should be banned. In a society full of deep-rooted racism, skin whitening does not help people in any way–trying to fit a set beauty standard simply isn’t and will never be a healthy mindset.</p>

    <h4>The product itself is toxic</h4>
    <p>Skin whitening products are toxic and have been proven to be toxic. These whitening products work by hindering the formation of melanin in the skin, however, they can also cause a number of health issues in your body. Using toxic skin whitening products can lead to symptoms such as rashes, discoloration, scarring, inflammatory issues, damage to the nervous, digestive, and immune system. Furthermore, constant exposure to the dangerous chemicals found in these products could lead to the destruction of melanin in a person's skin. Melanin is a pigment responsible for the color of our skin and when it is reduced, the skin will have less protection against UV rays–with this, something as simple as going out in the sun could potentially lead to conditions such as melanoma.</p>
    <p>Moreover, a handful of skin whitening products contain mercury which is bad for the skin. Mercury is a chemical element that can be dangerously corrosive when it makes contact with a person’s skin. Mercury has been proven to damage the brain, kidneys and the nervous system as a whole–mercury getting into the skin can also cause rashes, blotchy spots, and give the skin a grayish tint. A study conducted by the 2022 Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System documented 1143 single exposures to mercury or compounds containing mercury. In conclusion, 30 individuals suffered moderate toxicity and 5 had severe toxicity. How much more if we continued to allow the implementation of skin whitening products that actually do contain mercury? These products have been left onto the shelves of stores all across the world for anyone to purchase, oblivious to the harms these products can cause. Other common skin lightening agents – such as glutathione, hydroquinone, retinoids, and steroids – inhibit the production of melanin in a person’s skin. All of the mentioned skin lightening agents have been known to have negative effects on people who use it. Moreover, products that contain hydroquinone have been found to be associated with squamous cell carcinoma, the second most common form of skin cancer, through case reports.</p>
    <p>The regular exposure to these products are just not worth the dangers they may pose, not when these dangers could potentially be a cause for something as deadly as cancer. With the sheer amount of symptoms stated and studies conducted in regards to the toxicity these products pose to the skin, skin whitening must be banned</p>

    <h4>Cultural appropriation</h4>
    <p>The misuse of skin whitening products can potentially lead to cultural appropriation. Recently, especially in online spaces, people have been seen changing their skin color and parts of their natural features to look like another race. People not of asian-origin who desire to change their physical appearance may whiten their skin in order to appear asian which is simply cultural appropriation. Additionally, skin whitening products more often than not draw from and mimic traditional ethnic practices and remedies, without actually giving proper credit or respect to the cultures they came from. With the rise of Kpop as well as other asian media outlets, people all across the world began to have a strange fascination with asian cultures to the point where they romanticize one day turning asian. We can see this happen in modern times with figures such as Oli London whitening his skin and having surgery to change his features to appear korean. Time and time again we see people use skin whitening in harmful ways, cultural appropriation is just one of the many negative effects of using such a product.</p>

    <h3>Counterarguments</h3>
    <p>1. While it is true that skin whitening has often been associated with unrealistic beauty standards and has been linked to colorism, the desire for lighter skin isn’t always a result of a “toxic” mindset or societal pressure alone. For some individuals, skin whitening products can represent a personal choice or a means of self-expression, rather than an attempt to conform to a beauty standard. In a handful of cases, people with darker skin tones may seek skin whitening products to address hyperpigmentation, uneven skin tone, or age spots, which can occur naturally due to sun exposure or hormonal changes. For these individuals, skin lightening is not necessarily about wanting to be white but rather achieving a clearer, more even complexion, which the person may perceive as more aesthetically pleasing or simply healthier. In other words, the use of skin whitening products doesn’t always equate to a desire to adhere to a historical or societal notion of white skin as the ideal. </p>
    <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/skin-bleaching#:~:text=Skin%20lightening%20can%20even%20out,reduce%20the%20appearance%20of%20freckles" target="_blank">Skin Bleaching Products: Side Effects and Benefits</a>
    <p>2. It is extremely crucial to acknowledge that not all skin whitening products are equally harmful. While some whitening agents can have health risks, many products available today are formulated with safer, scientifically-backed ingredients that are intended to lighten the skin without causing serious harm. There are many clinics specified for skin lightening for the betterment of a person’s health. Take the AIVEE clinic here in the Philippines as an example. AIVEE clinics in the Philippines have certified dermatologists who help with clearing and evening damaged skin in the safest, healthiest way possible. Not all skin whitening products are bad and more often than not, especially during modern times, skin whitening is used medically to treat skin issues, not worsen them.</p>
    <a href="http://clairskin.in/skin-whitening-treatment" target="_blank">Skin Whitening Treatment</a>
    <p>3. The idea that the use of skin whitening products leads to cultural appropriation requires an in depth understanding of cultural practices and individual choice. Cultural appropriation typically refers to the adoption of elements of one culture by individuals from another culture, often without permission or understanding of the significance. Furthermore, while there are definitely cases where individuals may use skin whitening to alter their race or ethnic appearance, these instances should not be generalized to all users of skin lightening products. For the vast majority of users, skin whitening is about personal aesthetics or treating skin issues, not about trying to mimic or appropriate another culture. Lastly, it’s worth noting that cultural appropriation is a complex issue that involves power dynamics, history, and intent–it’s a whole other bigger issue entirely separate from skin whitening that involves so much more.</p>

    <div class="rebuttals">
    <h3>Rebuttals</h3>
    <p>1. While it is true that some people use skin whitening products to treat hyperpigmentation or even out skin tones, these reasons are still often influenced by societal beauty standards. In many cultures, lighter skin is still viewed as more desirable or professional, which pressures individuals with darker skin to conform. This widespread use of whitening products suggests that the desire for lighter skin is shaped by cultural conditioning that associates it with privilege and beauty. Even when the goal is to “even out” skin tone, it often reflects a deeper bias toward lighter skin tones. Whether intended or not, this reinforces the idea that lighter skin is superior, further contributing to harmful beauty standards and colorism in society. Thus, skin whitening even when not aimed at achieving “whiteness”, still perpetuates these toxic ideals.</p>
    <p>2. Not all skin whitening products are harmful for certain, however the reality is that many products on the market–particularly those available in unregulated markets–do contain dangerous chemicals like mercury, hydroquinone, and steroids, which may have been proven to cause long-term health damage. Even some products that claim to be “safe” can still have harmful side effects, especially if used excessively or improperly. Furthermore, even if a product is marketed as being “safe” or backed by dermatologists, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the long-term effects of constant skin lightening are well understood by the patient themselves. Just because a product is medically supervised or recommended by a clinic doesn’t mean it’s free from risk. </p>
    <p>3. While not every individual who uses skin whitening products is necessarily engaging in cultural appropriation, it’s important to recognize the broader context in which these very products are used. Skin whitening products are often marketed in ways that reflect unrealistic beauty standards where lighter skin is synonymous with wealth, status, and perfection. Cultural appropriation is not simply about mimicking another culture’s physical traits but about the power dynamics that exist when people from privileged get aspects of marginalized cultures. In this case, the global marketing of skin whitening products often reflects colonial attitudes where lighter skin is associated with higher social standing, and people from non-western cultures are encouraged to alter their appearance to conform to these ideals. The fact that many skin whitening products are targeted at people of color in countries like India, Nigeria, and the Philippines speaks to a broader cultural pattern of beauty</p>

    <h4>Beauty Product/Cosmetics is a staple to Philippine economy</h4>
    <p>Concerning the Consumer Good and FMCG in the Beauty and Personal Care segment, as published by Statista Research Dept, Personal Care and Skin Care has the largest revenue of 4.77B USD in the beauty market by year 2023 and is expected that the market will experience an annual growth rate of 1.23% by 2024-2029. Philippines, unsurprisingly, as a country with a very high enthusiasm in beauty pageants – male or female pageants - has made the beauty and cosmetics market flourishing in the Philippines. Along with the popularity of foreign fashion trends and skincare products which is a big Filipinos impulse, comes the growing demand for cosmetic/whitening and personal care items suited for Filipino skin type. Fueled with the Filipino’s high internet penetration rate, anything and everything can already be seen online, sold online, reviewed online, cosmetics has really been a reckoning growth in the country’s economy. </p>

    <h4>Skin Hyperpigmentation has an appreciable impact on one’s quality of life</h4>
    <p>Disorders of skin hyperpigmentation greatly impacts self-confidence of an individual carrying social and cultural importance that influences widespread consumer demand for cosmetic lightening products. Skin lightening continues to be a common practice and this can be achieved with soaps, over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription creams, pills, injections, and an assortment of cosmetic procedures nowadays. In a study conducted by Anne Taylor, about Prevalence of pigmentary disorders and their impact on quality of life; published in NIH National Library for Medicine, in which 80% of the participants were diagnosed with one or more pigmentary disorders. About 47.3% of patients admitted of feeling self-conscious about their skin to some degree, 21.8% felt others focused on their skin, 32.7% felt unattractive because of their skin, 32.7% put effort into hiding pigment changes, and 23.6% felt their skin affected their activities. More than half of the respondents then admitted of feeling conscious about their skin, making this a health issue concerning mental health.</p>

    <h4> Promotion and awareness of better ways of health products</h4>
    <p> It is known for a fact that whitening products contain mercury. A chemical that once found to be beyond 1mg/kg as set by FDA, can be found harmful. However, Feb 14 2023, WHO posted that a US$14-million initiative will support a holistic approach to eliminate the use of mercury from lightening products and promote the beauty of all skin tones. This joint project led by the governments of Gabon, Jamaica and Sri Lanka have joined force against damaging beauty practices, to eliminate the use of mercury in lightening products. Led by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), with funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and executed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Biodiversity Research Institute (BRI), the “Eliminating mercury skin lightening products” project will work to reduce the risk of exposure to mercury-added skin lightening products, raising awareness of the health risks associated with their use, developing model regulations to reduce their circulation, production, trade and distribution across domestic and international market industries. As GEF CEO and chairperson Carlos Manuel Rodriguez said, “This initiative is significant as it focuses not only on substitutions for harmful ingredients, but on awareness building that can help change behaviours that are damaging to individual health as well as the planet.” Thus, this enhancement towards our physicality is inevitable. People will always look for something they can improve; in ways everyone will improve. With demand for skin lightening products projected to grow to US$11.8-billion by 2026, fueled by a growing middle class in the Asia-Pacific region and changing demographics in Africa and the Caribbean, skin lightening products may be a global health issue, but let’s not deny the fact, the lighter your skin, the more beautiful people will perceive you to be. The lighter you are, people see you more. The lighter you are, people will less likely to bully you. The lighter you are, the more people find you attractive. And the lighter you are, the people will like you more. In this case, the lighter you are, the better.</p>

    <h3>Counterarguments</h3>
    <p>1. While the cosmetics and beauty sector in the Philippines has seen growth its economic importance is limited when considering the broader picture. This sector’s revenue, though notable at $44.77 billion in 2023, is a small fraction of the Philippines’ overall GDP which exceeds $400 billion. Industries such as manufacturing, agriculture, and BPO contribute far more to the country’s economy and employment. Moreover, the focus on beauty trends distract from the fact that these very beauty trends are toxic and pressure individuals to meet an unrealistic beauty standard. Whitening products should not be promoted as a means to say that having fair skin is more beautiful than any other skin tone which can be seen in these very pageants. In addition, much of the revenue in the beauty sector comes from foreign brands which means that the economic benefits do not stay within the country. Environmental concerns also begin to arise due to the waste and harmful chemicals associated with many beauty products such as mercury.</p>

    <p>2. While it is true that skin hyperpigmentation can affect an individual’s appearance and may cause feelings of insecurity, the claim that it has universally significant impact on quality of life overlooks a broader range of perspectives on beauty, self-esteem, and health. It’s important to recognize that societal views on skin color and beauty are often culturally constructed and vary significantly across different communities. Hyperpigmentation may be stigmatized in some cultures but in others it may not be perceived as negatively or may even be seen as a natural feature in some people. Therefore, its impact on self-confidence is not universal but highly dependent on societal standards and individual perceptions. The argument of skin hyperpigmentation directly being related with mental health issues such as anxiety or depression may also oversimplify the complexity of mental health. While the study you have referenced shows that a significant portion of individuals with pigmentary disorders feel self-conscious, this does not necessarily mean that their quality of life is significantly impaired across all aspects. Many people who have hyperpigmentation may manage their condition without it heavily influencing their emotional well-being, while others may find other ways to treat this.</p>
    <p>Moreover, the widespread consumer demand for skin-lightening products, driven by these concerns, raises significant health and ethical considerations. Skin lightening, whether through OTC creams, pills, or procedures, can carry dangerous risks including skin damage, side effects, and the reinforcement of harmful beauty standards. The pursuit of lighter skin can perpetuate colorism, which may further fuel feelings of inadequacy especially in communities where fair skin is idealized. This toxic cycle of societal pressure and consumerism only reinforces the idea that self-worth is tied to appearance, which can contribute to broader mental health concerns. To conclude, while hyperpigmentation in the skin may affect self-esteem in some individuals, its impact on overall quality of life is not as clear-cut as it may seem. The cultural, psychological, and health-related dimensions of skin color and beauty are complex, and focusing on one specific aspect may inadvertently overlook the larger, systemic factors that contribute to well-being.</p>
    <a href="http://medicalnewstoday.com/articles/" target="_blank">Skin Lightening Products can cause Health Problems</a>
    <p>3. While the promotion and awareness of safer health products, especially in terms of skin lightening is crucial, the assertion that “the lighter you are, the better” perpetuates harmful societal beliefs and reinforces dangerous beauty standards that can have long term negative effects on individuals and communities. Firstly, it is important to recognize that lighter skin being better is a social construct that has been deeply ingrained by centuries of colonialism, colorism, and cultural biases. This view is not universal and varies significantly across cultures. Many cultures and communities value darker skin tones and have rich traditions of celebrating their natural beauty. By saying skin lighting as a necessary improvement for attractiveness or social success we risk perpetuating a narrow standard of beauty that marginalizes people with darker skin tones. Furthermore, the idea that lighter skin leads to less bullying or greater social acceptance is not only problematic but also oversimplified. Social prejudices and discrimination based on skin color are deeply rooted in societal structures and do not simply vanish when people lighten their skin. Addressing colorism requires more than promoting skin-lightening products or changing one’s appearance; it requires changing harmful attitudes and dismantling the societal biases that contribute to racial discrimination. Relying on external physical alterations such as skin whitening to fit into a perceived standard of beauty does nothing to address these underlying issues. Moreover, specifically regarding health, the dangers of mercury in skin lightening products are well-documented and the initiative led by the World Health Organization to eliminate mercury from such products is an essential step toward safeguarding global health. Mercury exposure can cause severe health problems including skin damage, organ damage, and neurological disorders, and has a particularly harmful impact on vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women or young children. While it’s important to remove harmful chemicals from the beauty market, it’s equally important to challenge the demand for such products. Instead of just framing skin lightening products as an inevitable enhancement of one's physical appearance, we should focus on promoting self-acceptance and celebrating natural beauty in all forms, regardless of skin color. Going back, it is important to raise awareness about the dangers of mercury in skin lightening products but the broader issue lies in the societal pressures and beauty standards that fuel the demand for such products in the first place. Rather than promoting skin lightning as a way to achieve greater beauty or social acceptance, we should focus on challenging these narrow definitions of beauty and promoting diversity, self-love, and celebration of all skin tones. True improvement in both physical and mental well-being comes from embracing natural beauty, not altering it to fit a set standard.</p>

    <h3>Rebuttals</h3>
    <p>1. While there are in fact cases that personal choice plays a role in the use of skin whitening products, it’s important to recognize that these choices are often shaped by deeply entrenched societal pressures and systemic colorism. The desire for a lighter skin tone is not simply about preference but reflects a broader social context where lighter skin is valued over darker skin. Banning harmful products doesn’t remove personal autonomy, but it helps eliminate the dangerous products that promote these toxic standards. Rather than encouraging self-acceptance in a market flooded with unsafe products, we should work to eliminate these products altogether and create a safer, more inclusive standard of beauty that doesn’t rely on whitening the skin.</p>
    <p>2. Even with regulatory efforts, the harm caused by skin whitening products goes beyond just safety concerns—it’s the idea that changing one’s skin tone is necessary to achieve the beauty standard or societal acceptance. This reinforces the toxic belief that fair skin is the only ideal. Additionally, while safer alternatives may exist, the widespread availability of harmful products demonstrates the failure of regulation in many regions across the world. As long as the market continues to prioritize skin lightening, people will continue to face these risks, especially in unregulated or informal markets. Rather than allowing a potentially harmful industry to persist, it would be more beneficial to shift focus to promoting natural beauty and eliminating dangerous products from the market altogether.</p>
    <p>3. Skin lightening is inherently linked to the perpetuation of global beauty standards that favor whiteness, which does involve appropriation—though it may not always be intentional, it reflects the ongoing dominance of societal ideals. The idea that people use these products for personal choice without recognizing the cultural implications overlooks how these products are marketed as the path to social success or beauty. The normalization of skin lightening and the desire to mimic another culture’s aesthetic—whether Asian or Western—reinforces the power dynamics that shape these beauty standards. The solution is not just to focus on individual motivations but to address the broader cultural implications and the harm these toxic standards cause.</p>
