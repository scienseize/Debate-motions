    <h4>Teenage Pregnancy</h4>
    <p>Teenage pregnancy is a prevalent issue in the philippines but thanks to schools that choose to talk about sex education and contraceptives after the introduction of sex education teenage pregnancy rates have been on a slow decline until 2021 according to statistica and unesco. Unfortunately as of this moment it is only an implementation but not mandatory which leaves certain sections of the academic institutions to potentially leave out sex education entirely. This is putting our youths at risk of not practicing safe sex. If we make it mandatory we can fill in these gaps and reduce teenage pregnancy as teenage pregnancy has a lot of risks on the body so it is important that we reduce the rate of adolescent pregnancies.</p>

    <h4>Certain contraceptives</h4>
    <p>Certain contraceptives like Hormonal contraceptives such as birth control and surgical procedures such as hysterectomy it can help with certain reproductive conditions such as PCOS, acne, hormonal imbalances, endometriosis and adenomyosis by making contraceptives a mandatory curriculum these other aspects birth control have other uses other than preventing pregnancy for example dealing with aspects of contraception outside of sex could be discussed as well because most people assume that when a person says they take birth control they assume that the use is only to prevent pregnancy when in fact hormonal birth control and the surgeries has other uses that aren't exclusive to it. As conditions like adenomyosis and endometriosis are Chornic with the potential to get worse and spread through other organs nearby and can cause infertility if left untreated these lifelong chronic and oftentimes painful conditions only have one known way to deal with permanently the only current “cure” to the condition is to remove the uterus in its entirety or go into menopause </p>

    <h4>Contraceptive education empowers</h4>
    <p>Contraceptive education can empower those with the knowledge so that they are aware of the options available to help keep themselves safe and healthy as they can exercise their bodily autonomy being educated about the risks of sex and how to lower that risk and what option best suits them by providing the pros and cons of each because if we provide only one option such as IUDs where people might not discuss that some places do not provide painkillers for inserting IUDs and how IUDs are extremely painful or how you need to remove them when you have things like MRIs opening up the conversation regarding contraceptives can also help open other conversations such as consent and when things are acceptable appropriate and healthy in interactions with people</p>

    <h4>Pregnancy and STD prevention</h4>
    <p>Certain contraceptives not only prevent pregnancy but prevent STDS especially those that cause long lasting health issues like HIV that causes AIDS and HPV Which causes cancer in exposed areas if you're not vaccinated for it pre exposure and post exposure prophylaxis for example can help prevent contacting HIV. HPV is a virus that can cause cancer which may result in a person needing to get surgery or into chemo and other forms of treatment to deal with.</p>

    <p>1. Teenage pregnancy or pregnancy in general has a higher detrimental impact on ones body compared to hormonal birth control as mortality during childbirth or after childbirth these health risks can be permanent after the pregnancy occurs.Especially in a country where abortion is illegal with no exceptions with means means the chances of childbirth mortality is even higher Possible causes of death include infection/Sepsis, hemorrhage and complications.Compared to the health risks of hormonal contraceptives the risks of pregnancy and childbirth are significantly higher especially with the lack of healthcare in the cases of miscarrage.</p>

    <p>2. Contraceptives doesnt have to be exclusive to sex education it can be done alongside it. that would help further educate our filipino youths into making better choices, by exclusing contraceptives from the education system it is limiting the options people can take with their own reproductive rights and bodies. by preventing contraceptives such as condoms in sex education will increase the spread of STDs such as HIV and HPV by leaving those out of sex education it will put filipino youths at risk of coming into contact with these diseases. </p>
    <p>3. Having religion influence our laws in this case laws regarding education goes against the Philipine constitution.Specifically article 2 section 6 not only that but abstinence only as a form of contraceptive is actually quite ineffective and harmful as abstinence only programs tends to leave out essential information because abstinence no longer applies once your married according to some religions but STDs or other reasons such as couples not being ready for a child may still want to practice contraception. Not only that but abstinence only programs encourage further stigma towards the topic of sex and expressing sexuality another issue this has is that it excludes people who have experienced sexual assault or abuse as they have no way to protect themselves from pregnancy or STDs as abstinence is framed as a choice which then hurts the students that have already experienced being attacked</p>

    <p>Why would sexual activity in youths be an issue, so long as the teens practice safe sex safetly and within the appropriate age there is no issue in teens having sex regardless of if you educate these teens on contraceptives or not they will still do sex (check abstinence section on why abstinence is not effective) so why not educate them on how to do it safetly to protect themselves rather than make sex taboo. </p>
    <p>Not only that but there are sources to suggest that the opposite actually happens that lack or decline of sexual activity is what leads to depression, the counterarguement mentioned that there is many health risks to having sex with out prior knowledge, that is the point of having contraceptives as part of sexual education to GIVE that knowldge. As mentioned before contraceptive education doesnt need to be exclusive as it should be part of general sex education for reasons stated before on abstinence based education</p>
    <p>Just because contraceptives are not 100% effective doesnt mean it shouldnt be taught as mentioned in the first arguement some contraceptives such as hormonal birth control have other uses that arent just for preventing pregnancy. Contraceptive may not be 100% effective but neither is teaching abstinence as not everyone will practice it regardless of what you teach.</p>

    <h4>Negative effects of contraceptives</h4>
    <p>Contraceptives can have a negative effect on one’s body. Especially with hormonal contraceptives, as they can have adverse effects such as a disturbance to your sleep pattern, headaches, hair loss, as well as even cardiovascular diseases. Education focusing on how to have safe sex may gloss over the negative side effects of hormonal contraceptives in favour of teaching students how to have sex in a safe manner </p>

    <h4>Teaching responsibility and consent</h4>
    <p>Focusing on teaching students responsibility, consent, and pleasure is a more viable option towards sex education. These topics of interest can help bring guidance towards youth on what to do and make an informed decision on what to do in regards to sex and attraction within their relationships. It is far more important and impactful to a student to learn these than the simple, scientific knowledge behind contraception as they may not know what else to do with the information of contraceptive education without any guide around the other factors when having sexual relations, especially because young students do not have the necessary life experience and psychological intelligence.</p>

    <h4>Religious values</h4>
    <p>Religious communities often employ abstinence as their form of prevention, as well as a form of devotion to their religion. Mere focus on contraceptive education can sideline the equally valid option of abstinence, as well as disconnect sexual safety from religious values. A lack of inclusion towards the religious ideas about sex can undermine the religious values and morals they hold towards it. This is divisive for the reason that a large majority of people in the Philippines are religious. This means that contraceptive education shouldn’t be the primary focus of sex education within the Philippines and it does not have to be mandatory. Other aspects of sex education deserve the spotlight in order to educate the students for them to have a healthy relationship to their sexuality.</p>

    <h3>Counterarguments</h3>
    <p>Knowledge about contraceptives, while indeed reducing teen pregnancy, won’t necessarily decrease sexual risk behaviours in youth. Young people may still have an early sexual initiation in spite of knowledge about how to combat the health risks of having unprotected sex. A lack of knowledge on how to deal with sexuality and how to properly navigate relationships in regards to sex is also a factor on why teen pregnancy rates are so high. </p>
    <p>Aside from teen pregnancy, early sexual initiation can also increase the likeliness of getting depression having suicidal thoughts. As I’ve explained, it can not only introduce several health risks to someone to have sex without prior knowledge, but also psychologically damage them.Thus, guiding someone to have responsibility towards their sexual health as a youth is more worth it than prioritising contraceptive education. </p>
    <p>Contraceptives also (aside from contraception like tube ligation and vasectomies) are not 100% effective, and sometimes not affordable (such as with injected contraceptives and of course IUDS and the aforementioned methods of tubal ligation and vasectomy). Using sex ed as a way to promote a safe space to discuss topics about sex can open the door to discussions about natural planning and how to navigate their sex life if contraceptives don't work or are not an option.</p>
    <p>Sex Ed that focuses on interpersonal relationships and the wellness of students can also destigmatize sex as something that isn’t dirty to talk about. Destigmatizing sex ed can create comfortability around the topic of sex and make it easier for students to ask for guidance around their sexual health and diminish any sense of shame they may have around it.</p>

    <div class="rebuttals">
    <h3>Rebuttals</h3>
    <p>Teen pregnancy can be deterred not only by contraceptives. Knowledge of the consequences of unprotected sex can indeed reduce teen pregnancy. However, so can teaching children about how to have sex in a manner that also protects their mental and emotional wellbeing. More goes into protecting youth from teen pregnancy than knowledge about contraceptive methods. Some youth may feel pressured into having unprotected sex even when they have access to contraception. Teaching about consent, learning how to choose your partners, what to do when you’re in a sexually charged situation but you’re not ready, as well as cultivating attitudes that value sexual honesty constitute sexual responsibility. These behaviours can reduce teen pregnancy through methods that aren’t just contraceptives.</p>
    <p>While teen pregnancy is painful both on an emotional and physical scale, young students may not fully grasp the real, detrimental consequences that could occur if they choose not to use contraception.</p>
    <p>Religious students could still have a sex educator that can provide guidance that adheres to their values while still teaching comprehensive sex education primarily focused on sexual responsibility. Also, while there are many religious students, that doesn’t mean that abstinence-only is the kind of sex education that should be taught. Of course, religious students also deserve to have a comprehensive sex education as they may have sex at one point or another. The reason religious views should be considered is that religion can have an impact on how one values and views sexual intimacy, and that should not be overshadowed and deserves to be given guidance for.</p>
