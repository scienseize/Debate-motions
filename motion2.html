    <h3>Arguments</h3>
    <h4>Generally leads to multiple health risks</h4>
    <p> Although vaping has less health risks than smoking, e-cigarettes are not risk-free. Most e-cigarette use e-juice that contain nicotine, which is an addictive and harmful substance when mixed with other toxic chemicals from e-juices. In long-term exposure, nicotine raises blood pressure, narrows the arteries and causes addiction. Vaping can also cause breathing problems. The particles the user inhales while vaping causes inflammation and irritation in the lungs. This can lead to lung damage like scarring and narrowing of the tubes that brings air in and out of the lungs. Vaping e-liquids exposes the user to several potentially harmful chemicals, including diacetyl, a flavoring compound known to cause bronchiolitis obliterans or popcorn lungs. Vaping leaves the user likely vulnerable to getting asthma and other lung conditions such as lipoid pneumonia.. EVALI(e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury), originally known as VAPI(Vaping-associated pulmonary injury) are mainly effects of vaping or the use of other e-cigarette devices. It is a new kind of e-cigarette associated disease that causes severe lung conditions that require hospitalization. Among cases documented, 96% had undergone hospitalization including some who died. Nicotine, diacetyl and other harmful substances are mainly found in e-liquids or commonly known as e-juices. Additionally, when the e-liquid heats up, more toxic chemicals are formed. Short-term effects of vaping include coughing, dry and irritated mouth and throat, shortness of breath, etc.</p>

    <h4>Environmental Impact</h4>
    <p>E-cigarettes come in different variations, including disposable e-cigarettes which are mostly made with non-biodegradable components such as plastic, metal and batteries. Most vapes and other e-cigarette devices are made from plastics. Plastic waste especially is a rising environmental concern in every country. It takes hundreds of years for plastics to fully degrade and only a small percentage can only be recycled. Some plastics that came from e-cigarettes cannot be recycled due to containing toxic chemicals. It can also be consumed by animals resulting in injuries or death. E-cigarettes are powered by batteries, specifically ion-lithium batteries. If damaged or placed under extreme heat environments, it may cause explosions and fire. E-liquids contain a mixture of nicotine and other chemicals that are considered a hazardous waste. Hazardous waste is generally harmful to both humans and the environment if not disposed of correctly. There’s a possibility that it may contaminate our waters which would affect the population and it can be poisonous to fishes and other aquatic faunas. E-cigarettes release aerosols into the air which can contribute to air pollution, ozone layer depletion and greenhouse gasses. The e-cigarette industry is responsible for a sizable carbon footprint from manufacturing, packaging, and shipping products around the globe. The emissions from this supply chain can contribute to climate change.</p>

    <h4>Increases the likelihood of smoking regular cigarettes</h4>
    <p>One of the reasons vape was invented was to help users quit smoking. However, using vapes can more than likely be associated with transitioning to traditional smoking instead of quitting. Users are more likely to start smoking regular cigarettes and may develop other addictions in the future. E-cigarettes are more accessible than regular cigarettes with some users starting at a young age. Young people that used e-cigarettes had higher odds of becoming smokers a year later. A survey finds that more than a quarter of those who started using e-cigarettes went on to try regular cigarettes in the following year.</p>

    <h3>Counterarguments</h3>
    <p>1. They could claim that vaping is one of the most accessible stress relievers. Many, especially youths believe that vapes are a good option for stress relieving. There are safer options instead of vape and cigarettes e.g. nicotine-related medicines or physical activities. </p>
    <p>2. Many people say that there are less toxins found in vapes compared to traditional cigarettes. It is important to take note that vaping does not come off risk-free from psychological, physiological and physical health risks.</p>
    <p>3. They might also propose reducing the risks for the environment or suggest using metal vapes instead of plastic ones. Metal vapes consume more energy and contribute more carbon footprint than plastic vapes in manufacturing.</p>

    <p>Vaping is not a good option for stress relieving in the long term. Research shows that vaping can worsen mental health. Vaping can intensify symptoms of depression, anxiety and increase stress levels. Current e-cigarette users have double the odds of diagnosis of depression compared to non-vape users. The majority of young people who have used e-cigarettes started vaping to lessen feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression, and many continue vaping to cope with these feelings. Though they may be looking to nicotine for relief, many young people are unaware that vaping may make their symptoms worse. There are other alternatives that are much safer options for stress relieving such as nicotine-related medicines, social or physical activities. Nicotine patches are medicines approved by the FDA due to its steady dosage while being used daily to control withdrawal symptoms in order to help those quitting from smoking. Most of the dangers of smoking are due to the hundreds of toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke, not the nicotine. </p>

    <p>The shift from plastic to metal vapes offers some advantages, particularly in reducing plastic waste. Metal is typically more recyclable and tends to have a longer lifespan. Materials like stainless steel or aluminum are more durable and can be reused more effectively than plastic. However, the production of metal requires the mining and extraction of raw materials which can impact the environment. This process can lead to environmental damages, including deforestation and the destruction of habitats. Moreover, the carbon emissions that accompany metal production could offset some of the environmental benefits gained from decreasing plastic waste. Although metals are usually more durable and resistant to heat than plastics, some metals can pose serious health hazards if not manufactured correctly. Certain heavy metals, such as lead, cadmium, or nickel, can be toxic if they filter into the e-liquid or vapor generated by the device. If unsafe metals are used in the production of metal vapes, they could endanger the health of users.</p>

    <h4>Contributes to the economy</h4>
    <p>As of 2023 the e-cigarette and vape market is valued at USD 113.6 million and is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.7% from 2024-2030. In the Philippines the growth can be due to people seeing vapes as less harmful than cigarettes due to using nicotine instead of tobacco. The market for vapes is steadily growing and it contributes to the economy. Businesses pay the government taxes which the government will use to improve structures and use it for the people. If banned, that is a source of income for the government that will be gone significantly cutting into the projects that the government could do. </p>

    <h4>Less harmful compared to traditional cigarettes</h4>
    <p>Studies have shown that compared to traditional cigarettes, vapes and e-cigarettes do not contain tobacco which is the main substance that causes cancer in cigarettes. People who also want to quit using cigarettes could switch to vaping because it lacks that tobacco which reduces the risk of cancer. And unlike the risk that second hand smoking can cause to people that isn’t the case with vapes because at the moment, there is no sign that the vapors from vapes can harm anyone who breathes someone else's vapor. Cigarette smoking also releases thousands of chemicals into the air. Almost 70 of them can cause cancer, lung disease and stroke. And the most harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke include tar and carbon monoxide. Things that vapes don't have. </p>

    <h4>A way to stop cigarette users from relapsing</h4>
    <p>Studies have suggested that switching to vapes or e-cigarettes was more effective than other approaches to quit smoking. While the number may be low at 9 to 14 people who quit smoking using vapes it is still a higher number compared to 4 to 7 people with nicotine patches or or behavioral counseling. Unlike cigarettes there are vapes that have different nicotine strengths to control the amount someone intakes to help with withdrawal and cravings. Cigarette smokers usually have routines. Some will smoke after a meal or at a certain time and replacing the cigarette with a vape can still replicate the motions or the feel of smoking while also lessening the health risk. Of course, vaping isn't completely safe, the only way to get the entire benefit is to stop completely. Some people have been able to do the full switch while others may take a little longer.</p>

    <div class="counterarguments">
    <h3>Counterarguments</h3>
    <p>1. Vapes isn't the only problem Why should we single out vapes when there is also alcohol, gambling and even regular smoking that isn't being targeted. These are all equally bad things and can harm a person but they aren't being directly targeted.</p>
    <p>2. Vapes aren't the only contributor to waste Vapes is just one contributor to plastic waste in the Philippines, there are big corporations like Coca-Cola, Nestlé and other big companies that produce these plastic waste while vapes are just a small contributor to these. It isn't fair to single out vapes when there are other companies that create pollution and aren't being regulated.</p>
    <p>3. It can help people quit smoking There is a way to help smokers quit smoking by letting a smoker use a vape since it does have less of a health impact.</p>

    <h3>Rebuttals</h3>
    <p>Nicotine patches, while induce less Nicotine can still have a user addicted to it. Addiction comes in all forms, it is dependent on the user and proper regulation to make sure this doesn’t become an issue. Vaping, compared to Nicotine Patches, is also used as a substitute for cigarette smoking to help those addicted to cigarettes. Proper regulations and mandatory rules within using Vape should be applied, just like with alcohol and cigarette access. Removing Vape entirely in the picture, would mean removing means of substitute for individuals trying to get rid of their cigarette addiction.</p>
    <p>Alcohol, cigarette, gambling, all addictive use and practices that’s compared to Vaping, has a lot worse side effects that are regulated, some even not regulated, that are not banned so why should Vaping be the first to notion that fact? Why shouldn’t we banned the extreme addictive practices that had actively ruined livelihoods.</p>
