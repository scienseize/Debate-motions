    <h3>Arguments</h3>
    <h4>Air Pollution</h4>
    <p>We understand that the Jeepney has always been a traditional transport system that has been used by Filipinos for decades, but such liabilities that affects our respiratory system as passengers and the drivers themselves are at risk due to its fossil fueled engines. To add to that, due to the Vast amount of Fossil Fueled engine jeepneys are in the Philippines creates an effect to the atmosphere of cities and roads as a whole. There are recent studies of jeepneys being a one of the major sources of Black Carbon (BC) in the Philippines, especially in Metro Manila. This is a residue of combustion processes which have created higher Ambient Emission levels that can be life threatening to Filipinos. This can be a significant health hazard for our drivers which could be fatal if left unattended. One could say that we have used jeepneys for years and it has not been a detrimental issue for us. But with population going higher and the problems of Air pollution and Climate change arising throughout the years along with the creation of new jeepneys, we should not wait till it becomes too much for us to handle. Jeepneys with Poor Emission, mostly especially around atleast 15 years old or more are more under the threat of being phased due to excessive emissions and harmful gases which can be very damaging to the commuters and the drivers themselves. Majority of the engines are usually Japanese diesel engines that have been restored, and their exhausts frequently emit black soot. Jeepneys have been found to be a significant contributor to air pollution, accounting for 48% of Manila's airborne particulate matter and more than 15% of the nation's road transportation greenhouse gas emissions. </p>

    <h4>Safety and Comfort</h4>
    <p>The (PUVMP) Public Utility Vehicles Modernization Program, would also want a safer drive for our passengers. With the help of Modernized jeeps, having a An anti-lock braking system (ABS) and adjusting the designs of cranky sounds, balding tires, unsteady suspenses of jeepneys to enhance the welfare of commuters and Drivers of Jeepney public transportation. According to the article Design of the Philippine Jeepney for Crashworthiness Analysis: A Finite Element Analysis Approach, using computer-aided design (CAD) and FEA models created in SIEMENS NX, the FEA Design Centre Facility of the Metals Industry Research and Development Centre (MIRDC) of the Department of Science and Technology was able to assess the vehicle crashworthiness. The results of the simulated impact analysis showed that the current jeepney design is not well suited to withstand such crash impacts. Consequently, it may result in fatal injuries that could endanger its passengers. With the number of jeepneys growing in numbers on the road, it is best to have newer and modernized ones for the safety of the people and the commuters. Jeepney Operators are very much trustworthy when it comes to managing and using PUVs which was proven throughout the years but this doesn't reassure us that the vehicle itself could 100% guarantee safety amongst its commuters and could possibly have more possible injuries especially regarding the older jeepneys that has not been properly modified thorughout the years which leads to higher chances of fatal injuries and crashes.</p>

    <h4>Adaptation</h4>
    <p>With the outdated and old design of Jeepneys in the Philippines, such models are not applicable for the possible innovations of technology has to offer us. We can say that the traditional style of jeepneys and most commonly known as "King of the Road" is an important title to the hearts of Filipinos, but in terms of effectivity and efficiency, times will change, and we will have better options and possibilities for us to make use of. Providing the public with modernized jeepneys equipped with closed-circuit television cameras, GPS, automatic fare collection, and Euro 4 or electric engines to improve commuter efficiency and safety. Not only does these modernizations adjusts to the technological advances, but it also upgrades the PUV into a more standardized and regulated design which is more focused on efficiency and better sustainability. Having aircondition in the new E-Jeepneys can also give more comfort for our passengers and operators themselves which can help us avoid the risks of heatstrokes which are prevalent especially in tropical countries like the Philippines especially during the summer. In which a known example was during april this year in which The Philippines was hit by extreme heat, which forced thousands of schools to cancel in-person classes and issued warnings to people to limit their time outside. Wherein Heat index goes up to 43-47 Celsius in up to 30 cities and municipalities in the Philippines. Though people with jobs don't have the freedom to just suddenly stay at the comfort of their homes because many have families and their own to sustain, so most will still continue no matter the heat, especially the PUV drivers themselves.</p>

    <h3>Counterarguments</h3>
    <p>1. Fare costs going up due to loans for pricey modernized jeepneys. Due to the high price E-Jeeps to be bought by the jeepney operators, at around 2.5 million pesos. They are gonna have to raise the fare of commuters payment from the typical 13-20 pesos up to 40-50 pesos because they will have to keep up with the monthly loan that they will be paying for and also the for the charging stations that they usually will do.  This amount of stuff to pay will make it costly for the driver which leaves them no choice but to raise commute fair to let their ends meet and pay what they need to pay. To add to that, not all commuters will be able to afford that if they lose their usual affordable jeepneys which makes it harder for people, poor and young people to transport from one place to another.</p>

    <p>2. Employment of Jeepney Drivers will run out due to losing jobs during the phaseout, to add to that tons of drivers losing their jeepney PUVs will lessen PUVs on highways which makes it harder for people to commute. Everybody will more likely be aggressive when it comes going on to PUVs in general due to being too difficult to find ride with scarce affordable and accessible jeepneys</p>

    <p>1. There is an offer of affordable PUJs for marginalized drivers for marginalized drivers. With around 1.2 million php than your usual E Jeep, jeepney Operators wouldn't have to worry much about raising the fare too high to the point that it will cause issues to commuters when it comes to transport price.  To add to that, Landbank is open for loaning with low interests that could make it less of a burden for the fellow jeepney drivers in paying loan for the jeepney. </p>

    <p>2. With the addition of having loans for having affordable E jeeps. In an interview, Labour Undersecretary Benjo Benavidez stated, "DOLE is supporting the modernization program so that our jeepney drivers can be treated like regular workers who have a fixed salary rate and are covered by social benefits like SSS and PhilHealth."  For jeepney drivers who will remain employed under the jeepney modernization program, the Department of Labour and Employment (DOLE) is advocating for their regular employment status. This can help motivate jeepney drivers to properly get back on their feet after the phaseout. It can be quite difficult for them to handle the transition, the paperworks needed to be complied, and many more. But with the support of having proper salary and also being able to have a loan with low interests. This can motivate the drivers to comply and transition to the new E jeeps as a norm.</p>

    <h4>Employment Impact</h4>
    <p>Cudis C. (2019) from the Philippine News Agency stated that the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory board (LTFRB) announced that they will provide a 5% equity, a 6% interest, and a seven years contract regarding the payment of the modern jeepneys that would cost around 1.2 million to 3 million pesos. However, Many drivers and operators depend on traditional jeepneys for their livelihood. Phasing them out could lead to job losses and economic instability for these individuals and their families. Tendency that all of the 42,590 PUJ drivers would be unemployed due to a jeepney phase out. </p>

    <h4>Challenging transition from Traditional to Modernize Vehicles </h4>
    <p>Firstly the Philippines infrastructure has a limited availability of electric vehicles (EV) that charging stations wouldn't be able to spread further. This also indicate that it would be a high cost investment for the installation of EV charging stations as well as the ownership and maintenance of every charging station that would be deployed. Government also hinders to provide the EV charging stations and is still finalizing.</p>

    <h4> Accessibility and Affordability</h4>
    <p>Philstar Global stated that the jeepney fare could reach up to Php 50 in 5 Years due to the corporatized setup of the PUV modernization program meanwhile traditional jeepneys provide an affordable means of transportation for many Filipinos, especially those in lower-income communities. Replacing them with more expensive alternatives could lead to increased transportation costs for commuters. Jeepneys also has a wider area that covers most of the public transportation that is used thus they offer flexible routes that the local needs.</p>

    <h4>The Cultural significance of Jeepneys</h4>
    <p>Jeepneys have been a cultural relic their unique structure and striking colors with customization is one of the symbols of filipino ingenuity after world war 2 by phasing out jeepneys we are erasing a significant part of our history and the culture of jeepneys and with jeepneys and how it encourages interacting with the community during commute.</p>

    <div class="counterarguments">
    <h3>Counterarguments</h3>
    <p>1. Phasing out jeepneys would indeed affect the livelihood of a lot of people, but remember that with the transition will come job opportunities. Phasing out of jeepneys could lead to increased demand in jobs focused in manufacturing, driving and maintaining the new modern, eco-friendly vehicles. As per the plan of the government to subsidize the transition, they can offer programs to train drivers and mechanics alike affected by the transition. This also means that everything becomes more regulated and formalized, which indicates better wages and benefits for everyone in the sector. </p>
    <p>2. Initially, the transition would be challenging, change is always demanding especially when it is conducted in an enormous scale. But something to consider is, as this is a government initiated project, the government then are incentivized to invest in the project. This means building the infrastructure needed to support electric vehicles, including giving subsidies for the manufacturers of EV's and builders of the charging stations. This support would accelerate the availability of both the modernized vehicles and its infrastructure. Additionally, this can attract private investors which could further accelerate the release of charging stations and production of the jeepneys. This can enable local production of modernized jeepneys, relying on already existing companies or entrusting the task to ones who would like to enter the industry.</p>
    <p>3. Modernization might actually avoid fare increases or at the very least mean only a minimal increase with the promise of increased comfort and reliability for commuters. Modernized jeepneys, who run on electric engines, tend to be more energy-efficient and have lower maintenance costs than traditional models. These means increased savings for operators, which can offset the cost of modernization, helping to avoid the need to raise fares significantly. In fact, with lower fuel costs, fares might even decrease over time.</p>
    <p>4. Cultural preservation would not require continuous operation. These relics can be put in a museum for everyone to view and reminisce about. The cultural significance of jeepneys lies primarily in their design, history and symbolism rather than it being a staple of public transportation. We have no need to keep them in the roads in order to preserve the culture.    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="rebuttals">
    <h3>Rebuttals</h3>
    <p>1. Job opportunities may not necessarily match the skills of existing jeepney drivers and operators. A lot of drivers are self-employed or rely on informal work, and transitioning to new roles, may require skills that they don't currently have. Aside from that, government-provided training programs are often limited and may take time to implement. Especially for people who rely on working and earning daily to feed their families, they may not be able to take time away from work to attend training.</p>
    <p>2. These are all good concepts to talk about, but there is only uncertainty that comes with these. Government-initiated projects are reliant on political priorities, and any disruption could lead to delays and funding shortages. Additionally, building the infrastructure for electric vehicles is a massive project. In areas where the development is slow, jeepney drivers may struggle to access charging stations, disrupting their operations and impacting their income. Infrastructure should be built reliably first, to make the transition convenient and feasible for the drivers.</p>
    <p>3. The initial puchase price for the modernized jeepneys are deermined to be significantly higher than traditional jeepneys. Even with lower fuel and maintenance costs, it will take time to recoup these upfront expenses, putting the drivers and operators under unnecessary debts. Even if modernization ultimately results in cost savings, there's no guarantee that saving from fuel efficiency and reduced maintenance will be reflected in fare prices, if anything the operators can choose to still pass the costs to the commuters if they see an opportunity to raise fares.</p>
    <p>4. Jeepneys hold a unique cultural significance that cannot be captured or preserved fully by confining them to museums. They are part of a living culture, seeing them in action on the roads shows a cultural symbol that resonates with Filipinos' daily lives. A museum cannot capture the role jeepneys play as a unique form of public transportation.</p>
