    <h4>Provides Equitable access to quality Healthcare</h4>
    <p>Under a Mandatory Servitude, Medical Professionals will be able to provide equitable access to healthcare. More people will have access to quality healthcare necessary to what the community needs given that the quality of Medical Professionals per region should be possible to be maximized throughout the country. How the healthcare system functions in the philippines is that it goes through a State-subsidized system wherein the quality of healthcare is more present in urban regions whilst rural regions’ healthcare is lacking. Private healthcare is also more consistent than government funded, public ones. If governments are given more control in placing more services for people, it would also help having equitable healthcare in every region in the Philippines and not centralized on private, and richer communities.</p>

    <h4>Solves Shortages of Medical Professionals on rural parts of the country</h4>
    <p>Mandatory Servitude of Medical Professionals provides a solution to the shortages experienced of medical institutions all throughout the country. With a system that controls the density of Medical Professionals in a given community, less fortunate communities will still be able to have access to medical professionals. In many academic articles, it is said that the Philippines alone has a shortage of 190000 medical professionals and has a 1:25000 ratio to citizens than the recommended 1:10000. While this may be solved with having more medical professionals in the industry, a lot more of them can be placed in population dense or medically non-existent parts of the country. With more medical presence around the country, we could solve some shortages and even inspire more of our youth to become medical professionals.</p>

    <h4>More equipped in resolving Public health crisis</h4>
    <p>In light of many public health crises experienced within the pandemic, having Medical Professionals perform Mandatory Servitude would help a country be well equipped in solving the crises. When faced with an outbreak, the government will be able to mobilize a lot of Medical Practitioners where they need to be. Norway, as one of the countries that adopt Mandatory Service for its Medical Professionals, has been reported with their ability to suppress and control the outbreak based on their high performing decision-making and the high trust from their citizens. Such Crisis response is possible thanks to the mobility of having mandatory servitude applied to their medical professionals. A lot of situations may occur where there would be a lack of medical practitioners in a given area whilst having an abundance of such in other areas in the presence of a public health crisis. By providing Mandatory Service to communities lacking in medical personnel, medical professionals will be able to step in and help those communities to stop any outbreaks and to neutralize the situation in the country.</p>

    <p>1 . It’s not just the medical professionals that have a shortage but it's also the financial aid or the hospitals (equipment). To fix one problem it must be remedied by a solution that also fixes the other. According to an article, the backorder for medical equipment actually doubled over the years from an average of 400-500 to 800-1000 units of equipment. </p>

    <p>2. Providing the proper education gives more opportunities for most to become medical professionals solving the medical professional shortage. On top of that, importation of medical professionals may provide the same effect. </p>
    <p>3. There are organizations in place that can sufficiently help against pandemic level crises nullifying the need for government mandated actions Like WHO which even had a major hand in helping countries like the Philippines organize itself against COVID 19</p>

    <p>1.  Both can be remedied under mandatory servitude as most of the medical equipment is gonna be easily inspected if different medical professionals are in place. A system where multiple medical professionals can inspect a single workstation could drastically shape what medical standard all of those professionals can work with</p>
    <p>2. It relies on the fact that the government has to fix another sector it lacks and it doesn’t have an immediate effect to be considered a good solution. There is also not enough incentive for medical professionals outside the country to come to the Philippines to provide aid. </p>
    <p>3. Those organizations are not government controlled therefore it may be subject to questionable quality of treatment. Some of the organizations also prioritize less wealthy countries therefore the Philippines will not be prioritized as much as struggling countries.</p>

    <h4>Low Salary in the Philippines</h4>
    <p>Philippines is known to have many OFW workers from across the globe, this is mainly because of the high paying salary that the other countries can offer. One of the known OFW workers are nurses due to the demand of other countries needing nurses, competing for it even. Because of the high paying salary, Filipino medical professionals prefer to go abroad so that their income is better and to help their family. An example of this is a Filipino nurse Amir Pagadilan, who was a medical encoder in the morning shift and a hemodialysis at the night, when he learned he passed an interview for a job in Manitoba, Canada; he hopes to take on that opportunity because it will improve his salary. Although for nine years of hard work serving Filipino patients in which he finds joy and fulfillment, he chooses to go abroad because with a family of his own, his current income is not enough hence why he has struggles with two jobs. This implies him working in the Philippines is just not enough to make many sacrifices as time passes.</p>

    <p>During the pandemic, a Facebook post from the DOH calls for medical professionals to commit to work against COVID-19; if an applicant gets accepted, the said health worker will work in one of three referral hospitals, provided with free food and accommodation for one months with a compensation of P500 per day. This causes spark in the public, commenting in the likes of “stop exploiting health workers.” Jay Anne Chua, says that although health workers of course would like to help the country with a P500 as a hazard pay undermines the minimum daily wage in Metro Manila. Other accommodations such as shelter or free food is an option but ultimately, receiving a high paying salary is better, volunteering that time would mean you do get such benefits but will only last a month, which will make things harder inevitably due to the P500.</p>

    <h4>Lack of management in Public HealthCare Facilities</h4>
    <p>Research was conducted to see the issues lined with hospital facilities among public health care institutions. As a result, most concerns from the client satisfaction surveys and other methodologies used, rooted with the lack of resources, equipment, and technological innovations. So, whether the mandatory servitude is implied or not, there would still be a problem of possible lack of a better health care in public hospitals due to the lack of materials and such.</p>
    <p>Public Hospitals from Laguna that are administered by the provincial government or local government are at a level 1 accreditation. This level of accreditation was based on the Philippine Department of Health specified from the classification of hospitals in general, this kind of level tells us that these hospitals are only available for basic hospital services. Institutions like these are not capable for a higher-level health risk or clinical laboratories which can lead risks for families who cannot afford to be in private hospitals, leading to an under-provided medical treatment.</p>
    <p>Due to these lackage, even if medical professionals who are in servitude cannot provide utmost healthcare and would then compromise which can lead to the local communities’ health risk overall. With very limited resources, the public hospitals are in dire need to improve facilities to maintain operations by the Department of Health’s objective set in order to deliver a successful health service.</p>

    <h4>Can lead to decrease of Medical Professionals</h4>
    <p>Burnout is inevitable is the work field, but with a lot of factors piling up, it can lead to resignation or change jobs, or location even. We all know that the salary is low and with a combination of high-cost living, it can change someone’s mind to their choice of profession. Implementing mandatory servitude can be a large factor that leads to a decrease In the field of medical, that they would choose other options rather than serving mandatory. This article was able to prove that burnout causes resignation or change profession, another factor is overworked conditions which can be even more if the servitude applies. Philippines is already in a threat of understaffed medical professions so it is inevitable that one can experience burnout while doing the servitude and due to the understaffed.</p>
    <p>Because of these factors, it discourages people or students who wish to choose this kind of field, although it may be their passion, it will lead to hard work efforts in vain. This can make nurses feel exploited which can cause distress and add more to burnout. As said in the article, Reuters (Reuters, 2023) quoted: “For four years, you have studied, worked hard to become a nurse and to earn your license only to receive an income that defies the meaning of living wage. Where’s the justice in that?” It was already mentioned that the cost of living is already hard enough as it is, and only added servitude in these circumstances further pushes aspiring medical professions to change courses.</p>

    <div class="counterarguments">
    <h3>Counterarguments</h3>
    <p>1. They might propose to increase the salary but we all know Philippines itself cannot financially, however they might promote to increase the benefits as medical professionals in the working medical field. As mentioned, to those who volunteered during the pandemic will receive free shelter and such, this can imply that the government can give benefits that can help the worker and the family even if its not raising the salary. However, if this falls through, benefits can be limited or to some not worth of the professional’s hard work. Increasing the benefits to some extent can or might convince medical professionals to stay if those said benefits can actually help an individual’s cost of living. </p>
    <p>2. If a patient from a public hospital cannot be treated well, they can change hospitals and go to a private hospital instead, this can be a counter-argument as when the patient does change hospitals; medical service can be paid off through health card or insurance. Acquiring health card can be useful but the silver lining is that people still need to pay for it with interest, so although it is recommended, it risks the cost of living to the local communities. Another proposal is to importing equipment from other countries yet this is more of a stretch since equipment can be defected upon arrival and can add more debt to the country. </p>
    <p>3. Burnout causes through a tough work schedule, simply propose that the servitude implemented can be beneficial because they can imply that the work shifts are more tolerable. Accommodations can be part as the benefits in the servitude, making the value in work more prominent as these accommodations can make a person save money or their income. While burnout can take a long-time frame depending the stress of a worker, policy-making for this servitude must be accurate to the needs of both parties, in which both patient and ultimately the medical professionals can benefit in the field. Meaning that they might propose a servitude which is beneficial to all and this can lead to encourage more doctors or nurses to continue studying or work in the medical field.</p>

    <h3>Rebuttals</h3>
    <p>1. Some healthcare companies have a TRM philosophy. TRMs are important as it gives value and worth of one’s hard work and effort in exchange of monetary and non-monetary rewards however, companies that do practice TRM have been ineffective with its system and policies. Thus, the gap between the experiences of these benefits that TRM promised opposed to the companies without TRM really don’t differ from one another. A possible reason for a defect in the system is the ineffective integration of TRM in the company’s practice or that improvement may not be sufficient to justify a shift towards a higher income and other socioeconomic benefits for employees. There are already attempts in giving benefits in this work of field yet proven to be defective and insignificant, these rewards are deemed impossible to implement because of the current health system. There are already policies that can potentially benefit these medical professionals but because of the shortage (shortage is caused by low salary as well), the implemented policies are turned to be defective and does almost or nearly nothing beneficial. </p>

    <p>2. There is obviously a duality in hospitals: those who can afford and those who cannot. It is obvious how private health cares provide better quality in most of the areas that public health cares lack of. As time passes, middle class couldn’t even afford in private hospitals due to the higher price ranges of services, meanwhile the most public hospitals continuously landslide in decline and decay, starved from the subsidy by the government. And with the Medicare or PhilHealth to cover only a small portion of the cost of service, this kind of system cannot stay the same in a matter of time. This would only lead to higher prices in health cares, continuous lack of improvement for public hospitals and a high risk in the community’s health care. There is a constant and dire need in these kinds of hospitals but most especially public ones as it has and needs to be very accessible to everyone of every kind of class. Managing and improving is a priority and must be considered instead of creating a temporary solution that can cause more damage on the problem/s itself.</p>

    <p>3. Burnout is caused by many reasons as per this article; high workload, low rewards and in the likes. There are also other classified factors which are low nurse staffing levels, lack in schedule flexibility, and high job demand. Because of burnout, the effects of it are low job performance, poor quality care and intention to leave. In order for burnout to be subsided, such factors must be solved and draw out so it could cause less stress to the hard-working nurses. But with the number of factors and problems, it is hard to determine which must be in priority and which are tolerable, creating a servitude to address this issue can be challenging and difficult as the factors of burnout cannot be easily solve in just a small-time frame. It might take years of improvement and small steps to even fully subdue the problem. Implementing servitude can cause more problems because it can come with drastic changes which can lead to even more stress to adapt, to maintain a balance with burnout and the servitude to be implemented.</p>
