    <h4>Provides Equitable access to quality Healthcare</h4>
    <p>Under a Mandatory Servitude, Medical Professionals will be able to provide equitable access to healthcare. More people will have access to quality healthcare necessary to what the community needs given that the quality of Medical Professionals per region should be possible to be maximized throughout the country. How the healthcare system functions in the philippines is that it goes through a State-subsidized system wherein the quality of healthcare is more present in urban regions whilst rural regions’ healthcare is lacking. Private healthcare is also more consistent than government funded, public ones. If governments are given more control in placing more services for people, it would also help having equitable healthcare in every region in the Philippines and not centralized on private, and richer communities.</p>

    <h4>Solves Shortages of Medical Professionals on rural parts of the country</h4>
    <p>Mandatory Servitude of Medical Professionals provides a solution to the shortages experienced of medical institutions all throughout the country. With a system that controls the density of Medical Professionals in a given community, less fortunate communities will still be able to have access to medical professionals. In many academic articles, it is said that the Philippines alone has a shortage of 190000 medical professionals and has a 1:25000 ratio to citizens than the recommended 1:10000. While this may be solved with having more medical professionals in the industry, a lot more of them can be placed in population dense or medically non-existent parts of the country. With more medical presence around the country, we could solve some shortages and even inspire more of our youth to become medical professionals.</p>

    <h4>More equipped in resolving Public health crisis</h4>
    <p>In light of many public health crises experienced within the pandemic, having Medical Professionals perform Mandatory Servitude would help a country be well equipped in solving the crises. When faced with an outbreak, the government will be able to mobilize a lot of Medical Practitioners where they need to be. Norway, as one of the countries that adopt Mandatory Service for its Medical Professionals, has been reported with their ability to suppress and control the outbreak based on their high performing decision-making and the high trust from their citizens. Such Crisis response is possible thanks to the mobility of having mandatory servitude applied to their medical professionals. A lot of situations may occur where there would be a lack of medical practitioners in a given area whilst having an abundance of such in other areas in the presence of a public health crisis. By providing Mandatory Service to communities lacking in medical personnel, medical professionals will be able to step in and help those communities to stop any outbreaks and to neutralize the situation in the country.</p>

    <h4>Low Salary in the Philippines</h4>
    <p>Philippines is known to have many OFW workers from across the globe, this is mainly because of the high paying salary that the other countries can offer. One of the known OFW workers are nurses due to the demand of other countries needing nurses, competing for it even. Because of the high paying salary, Filipino medical professionals prefer to go abroad so that their income is better and to help their family. An example of this is a Filipino nurse Amir Pagadilan, who was a medical encoder in the morning shift and a hemodialysis at the night, when he learned he passed an interview for a job in Manitoba, Canada; he hopes to take on that opportunity because it will improve his salary. Although for nine years of hard work serving Filipino patients in which he finds joy and fulfillment, he chooses to go abroad because with a family of his own, his current income is not enough hence why he has struggles with two jobs. This implies him working in the Philippines is just not enough to make many sacrifices as time passes.</p>

    <p>During the pandemic, a Facebook post from the DOH calls for medical professionals to commit to work against COVID-19; if an applicant gets accepted, the said health worker will work in one of three referral hospitals, provided with free food and accommodation for one months with a compensation of P500 per day. This causes spark in the public, commenting in the likes of “stop exploiting health workers.” Jay Anne Chua, says that although health workers of course would like to help the country with a P500 as a hazard pay undermines the minimum daily wage in Metro Manila. Other accommodations such as shelter or free food is an option but ultimately, receiving a high paying salary is better, volunteering that time would mean you do get such benefits but will only last a month, which will make things harder inevitably due to the P500.</p>

    <h4>Lack of management in Public HealthCare Facilities</h4>
    <p>Research was conducted to see the issues lined with hospital facilities among public health care institutions. As a result, most concerns from the client satisfaction surveys and other methodologies used, rooted with the lack of resources, equipment, and technological innovations. So, whether the mandatory servitude is implied or not, there would still be a problem of possible lack of a better health care in public hospitals due to the lack of materials and such.</p>
    <p>Public Hospitals from Laguna that are administered by the provincial government or local government are at a level 1 accreditation. This level of accreditation was based on the Philippine Department of Health specified from the classification of hospitals in general, this kind of level tells us that these hospitals are only available for basic hospital services. Institutions like these are not capable for a higher-level health risk or clinical laboratories which can lead risks for families who cannot afford to be in private hospitals, leading to an under-provided medical treatment.</p>
    <p>Due to these lackage, even if medical professionals who are in servitude cannot provide utmost healthcare and would then compromise which can lead to the local communities’ health risk overall. With very limited resources, the public hospitals are in dire need to improve facilities to maintain operations by the Department of Health’s objective set in order to deliver a successful health service.</p>

    <h4>Can lead to decrease of Medical Professionals</h4>
    <p>Burnout is inevitable is the work field, but with a lot of factors piling up, it can lead to resignation or change jobs, or location even. We all know that the salary is low and with a combination of high-cost living, it can change someone’s mind to their choice of profession. Implementing mandatory servitude can be a large factor that leads to a decrease In the field of medical, that they would choose other options rather than serving mandatory. This article was able to prove that burnout causes resignation or change profession, another factor is overworked conditions which can be even more if the servitude applies. Philippines is already in a threat of understaffed medical professions so it is inevitable that one can experience burnout while doing the servitude and due to the understaffed.</p>
    <p>Because of these factors, it discourages people or students who wish to choose this kind of field, although it may be their passion, it will lead to hard work efforts in vain. This can make nurses feel exploited which can cause distress and add more to burnout. As said in the article, Reuters (Reuters, 2023) quoted: “For four years, you have studied, worked hard to become a nurse and to earn your license only to receive an income that defies the meaning of living wage. Where’s the justice in that?” It was already mentioned that the cost of living is already hard enough as it is, and only added servitude in these circumstances further pushes aspiring medical professions to change courses.</p>
