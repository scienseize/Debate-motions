    <h4>Fair Access to Resources</h4>
    <p>State universities, while providing sanctioned educational opportunities for students alike, also provide free tuition, that’s why it is often that scholars from impoverished backgrounds choose to enroll to these schools so that they can still have access to education without the worry of needing financial aid. However, there had been evidential data showcased In 2013, for example, it was found that over 72% of UP students were in the A and B income brackets, while only 12% were in C, 9.6 were in D, and 6.2% were in E. The slots in State universities are limited, so it should be a priority for students, who are less privileged to be able to fund their education but have the capacity to work hard with their academics. Upperclass students have more options in terms of their education, specifically private institutions that give them the same proper quality of education. The UP system’s budget is about P10 billion. How many poor students are there in UP who do not have to pay tuition fee? Just 2,544 or 6 percent of its 41,356 students. </p>

    <h4>Escaping Poverty</h4>
    <p>Proper education is a stepping stone for the youth’s success, it opens different doors of career opportunities for them which is greatly important for students who come from impoverished backgrounds. The national poverty incidence among families in 2023 was recorded at 10.9 percent. This is equivalent to 2.99 million Filipino families without enough income to meet their basic food and non-food needs. Having the proper resources, such as an educational institute that could provide for youth who work hard to have a chance to even attend school, could give them the chance to improve their livelihood greatly, not only for themselves but for their family. Escaping from poverty is difficult, it is a cycle that the government has yet to prioritize in this country and is a constant systematic problem. A lot of those who are not privileged cannot escape, state universities can provide upcoming students with a quality education without the worries of financial struggle for his/her families. It should be considered for them to be a priority, for the education system in supporting the proper aid in ensuring a hard-working student do not have their inability to pay due to circumstances of poverty be a shackle in reaching their achievement in life.</p>

    <h4>Social and Economic Disparities</h4>
    <p>According to the ASEAN Trade Union Council, the Philippines has the third highest economic and social inequality rate in Southeast Asia. This problem is not limited to personal wealth. The growing disparity between the Philippines' richest and poorest citizens also affects land distribution, educational and vocational opportunities, and basic welfare programs. Economic inequality has been pronounced and even more so for the last decade,The indigenous people are frequently the ones that suffer the most. Roughly 1.7 million members of the 100 ethnic groups that make up the Philippines continue to face the greatest disadvantages, with discrimination and a lack of opportunities posing significant obstacles. State universities should prioritize students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, providing them access to quality education and bridging the gap between the rich and the poor. This would promote social mobility of improvement within the Philippine's economic background. Prioritizing a merit-based admission system within state universities will be able to prioritize students from lower social standing who produce quality achievement within their academic standing, proving the hard work they put out for their education, should be recognized and be uplifted by the country’s system. This would erase the supposed disparities and inequality driven by discrimination, building a foundation for those struggling with their economic status, as the youth should be able to excel within their educational rights without worrying about their limited resources. </p>

    <p><strong>Purpose of State universities: </strong>It is argued that the constitution pertains to the freedom of all, and having the rights for education. Yet for students who are underprivileged, cannot exercise those rights due to the fact that they do not have access to education due to slots being taken from those who are privileged. Upper Class citizens have the option to choose a private institution that provides the same merit of quality education. Those who are underprivileged do not have the financial resources to access education that are of quality and could further exercise their education. State universities, are built to be accessible to those who have limited opportunities due to their financial background, underprivileged students should not be forced to take education that of low quality when a state university can offer good quality education, they should also be able to exercise their right to education, not be taken from it. </p>

    <p><strong>Equal Education Access </strong>Ensuring proper access to education for those who are underprivileged is one that university offers, while yes, you can say that everyone has the right to decide on their educational future, universities are accessible for those who do not have the privilege of right to choose due to financial constraints. If Upper Class individuals take the space and slots in universities, it would limit the students who DO need those financial aids. Regardless one’s financial background, every youth should be given equal opportunity of education, especially for those with limited choice of their education. </p>

    <p><strong>Lack of Resources </strong>How can we ensure that those who are underprivileged will be able to provide themselves with tutors? Through research, UPCAT reviews cheapest option is 6k, and this doesn’t include Live online review classes or materials for students. Students of those underprivileged would struggle to find proper educational assessment without worrying about the financial burden. Those of more privilege could easily access those extra academic help, those underprivileged rely on themselves or from previous educational institutions.</p>

    <p>While School Universities are entitled to choose those who surpass their applications, Upperclass Individuals, if they were rejected, still have varied choices, as mentioned before, They won’t have any financial difficulties if they were to inquire in Private Institutions. What about the Underprivileged students who couldn’t get a slot due to it being overfilled already? School Universities should put priority to those who excel in academics and are in need of financial aid, this is about students who are underprivileged yet excel in their studies but struggle to go to schools due to lack of resources. </p>
    <p>If Universities were to prioritize and specifically aid underprivileged students, it would open more doors for students at lower income brackets. They won’t experience the disparities and inequalities of educational availability and could have the proper quality education that Upperclass brackets experience.</p>
    <p>Going back to the accessibility, the constitution supports human rights to accessible education, State Universities, prioritizing those of the lower income bracket practice this constitution, as it gives accessible and equal education to the underprivileged. Upperclass individuals, losing one option won’t greatly affect their future while those who are more underprivileged, due to limited choices, have a bigger impact if they were depraved of this choice.</p>

    <h4>Freedom of education</h4>
    <p>The freedom of education is a human right stated in the constitution. The constitution states that education in general will be protected and every citizen has the right to quality education at any level which includes the college level and to take appropriate steps to make it accessible. While state universities were made with the idea of letting students who cannot pay the tuition in mind, that doesn't mean that a group of students should be excluded. No one should be excluded for something that is outside their control. A student should not sacrifice their education just because they’re rich, a school like UP has a good education and because of the lack of tuition giving students more academic freedom. </p>

    <h4>People should not be excluded from getting an education</h4>
    <p>People have the free will to choose what college they enter, there isn’t a set rule that if you’re rich then you shouldn’t go to state universities. It is not fair for the students to refuse a spot in a top university which is a good school because of something they cannot control. Public universities were made to make education accessible and as stated in the constitution, people have the right to a quality education and if the students see themselves getting quality education at a state university then we should be able to respect their choice because they are ultimately doing it to better themselves.</p>

    <h4>Just because a person is rich doesn’t mean they didn’t work hard.</h4>
    <p>Students who are in a higher income bracket have more advantages compared to those who went to less funded public schools. But that doesn’t mean they didn’t work. If they can afford it they go to review centers where they get reviewers, take mock exams and get tips on how to enter a state university. But that doesn’t mean that will give them a spot in a state university, it's only a stepping stone and the student is still expected to do the work. Even with the resources it's all useless unless you actually put in the work into studying and reviewing. </p>

    <h3>Counterarguments</h3>
    <p>The school is entitled to their own ways of screening applicants A state school like UP has a lot of applicants who want to join but limited slots so of course they’re entitled to hold exams where the best students are picked. They have to screen applicants and pick the ones that are best for the school. The school has the right to reject applicants if they do not meet the standard because a slot can;t be given out due to pity. A student really needs to study hard and to improve if they really want to enter a state university like UP. </p>
    <p><strong>UP college admissions:</strong> The school isn’t the reason why lower class students aren’t passing As stated in the constitution where every citizen gets the right to a good education. The reason why most lower class students aren’t getting into state universities as easily as their upper class counterparts is because of the failure of the government when it comes to giving students a proper high school education. Public schools aren’t as well funded as private leading to students being behind compared to those who have money. A state university like UP cannot be blamed for the government's lack of proper fixes for the public education sector and students who wish to go to state universities because of the quality education cannot be blamed because of the government's lack of action.</p>

    <p><strong>Equal Education from the government: </strong>Due to the divide between public and private schools, it's more likely for those with money to get admitted to state universities but because of the lack of funding towards public schools makes the divide more apparent. The constitution states that every citizen should get a quality education but how is that possible when the government refuses to step up and give more funding to the public education center.</p>
    <p><strong>Students pick schools based on the course: </strong>Students usually go to schools with the courses they wish to pursue. There are instances where a course is not available in a particular university but there is in a school like UP because it is funded by the government and could provide the student the course they wanted. A student should not compromise their own happiness and pick a different course in another university like Ateneo because that course isn't available. </p>
    <p><strong>Many other alternatives to review centers: </strong>Students are given almost a year or two to start reviewing for the UPCAT. They can choose to hire a tutor or go to a review center but there are options online or the private library. There are places where they have questions from previous years UPCAT that the student could practice or could go on forums to ask former UPCAT takers for tips. They could also try going to the public library for books or if they need something specific they could try looking for the books online. Lower class students don't have traditional methods to study for the UPCAT but they still have a fighting chance when they look in the right direction.</p>
