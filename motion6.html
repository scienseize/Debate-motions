    <h4>Environmental Impact</h4>
    <p>Plastic is designed to last. Plastic is what we use for almost everything, with the ability to last a lifetime for the convenience in use. According to chariotenergy.com, plastic can last 20-500 years to decompose, depending on the material and structure of the item. Plastic isn't natural; plastic doesn’t exist in nature; thus, it isn’t safe for the environment and can leak toxins from the soil. When the common compound of plastic is made of toxic chemicals, for example, bisphenol A (BPA) and PS oligomers, both are found in our common everyday use, including food and drink containers. Plastic does not eventually break down because plastic cannot be biodegradable; instead, it undergoes another process called photodegradation, where instead of a bacterium that breaks down the plastic, unlike human/animal excretion, wood, and plants decompose by UV rays that break the bonds of plastic holding the long molecular chain together. Over time, this turns into bits and pieces of plastic until they are too small to be seen. Because of this, every plastic molecule produced since 1907 is still present in the environment. Plastic also contributes to the climate crisis. According to un.org, the production of plastic is one of the most energy-intensive manufacturing processes in the world. 1.8 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, or 3.4% of the total worldwide, were produced by plastics in 2019. Plastic is not easy to dispose of. With the use of incineration, plastic releases greenhouse gases (GHG) with toxic pollutants. Even with recycling, they also emit GHG. Because of the rapid growth of plastics fueled by natural gas, plastics could reach about 13% of the entire remaining carbon budget by 2050.</p>

    <h4>Removing Convenience Culture</h4>
    <p> Plastic is used too much. Plastic is made from fossil fuel-based chemicals, meant to be disposed of right after. Single-use plastic has a problem as its use is to be thrown away immediately. Instead of investing in good-quality products that will not only last long but can also be a healthier use. Consumers are used to prioritizing convenience over durability or consideration. Because of this, companies use this advantage to use plastic for every product they make because not only is it cheaper, but it is also an easier way to produce than wood or other natural materials. In 2019, the globe generated over 460 million metric tons of plastic, which is already twice as much as was produced in 2000, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). We forget that the smallest things that we use, like plastic straws, plastic bags, plastic cups, and many more, have the potential to pollute for decades, centuries, or a millennium for every living organism on earth. Big manufacturers of single-use plastics have the potential to affect the environment. Products from Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and Unilever were shown to be among the most common in 2023. Three million metric tons of plastic packaging are produced daily by Coca-Cola alone, which is equivalent to an alarming 200,000 plastic bottles every minute. Unfortunately, as is the case with numerous worldwide corporations, that number keeps rising.</p>

    <h4>Economic Cost in Plastic Pollution</h4>
    <p>Plastic pollution is not just harming the ecosystem. Marine plastic pollution costs up to $2.5 trillion yearly. People are less likely to stay in places that are littered. Littered beaches thus face higher cleanup costs and lower tourism earnings. According to researchers, plastic pollution causes a 1-5% decrease in the services provided by marine ecosystems. This decrease amounts to an average loss of $500 billion to $2.5 trillion. The cost of plastic pollution is almost for about $33,000 per metric ton. The lifetime cost of plastic production in 2019 alone was US$3.7 trillion, more than India's GDP, according to a recent study by Dalberg that WWF commissioned. If nothing is done, this cost is expected to quadruple for plastic created in 2040. Currently, almost 200 million tons of plastic trash are produced by humans each year. This is equivalent to about 523 trillion plastic straws, which would make over 2.8 million. Over 11 million tons of plastic enter the ocean annually, and nearly half of this debris is improperly managed, it is burned in the open, disposed of directly, or leaks into the environment. The huge quantities of plastic trash generated yearly require more than US $32 billion to collect, sort, dispose of, and recycle. This represents an increase in waste management expenses. The annual cost of cleaning up after the waste can reach US$15 billion for governments, non-governmental organizations, and concerned citizens. The economic effects of marine plastic pollution can be huge, with estimates of the GDP losses for 2018 alone reaching up to US$7 billion. The decline in tourism, fishing, aquaculture, and other economic streams is the main cause of this</p>

    <h3>Counterarguments</h3>
    <p>1. In terms of improving the environmental impact, replacing plastic could cost more and use more energy. Using alternative materials for plastic like wood, plants, and metal takes time and more money to produce, transport, and sell, increasing the already low income of the population today. Having to use more agricultural resources for the everyday basic necessities of the people could also lead to a decline in natural resources and the need to produce a lot of materials. </p>
    <p>2. A counterargument they might say plastic is just too useful to ban. People rely on it for many things; it’s everywhere in our daily lives because it's cheap, durable, and convenient. And it’s not just about everyday items; plastic plays a huge role in healthcare. Single-use plastics are often the safest option for medical tools and packaging because they prevent contamination and are easy to dispose of safely. Hospitals use plastic for storing blood, solutions, and other essential supplies. Banning plastic production could seriously impact healthcare and other important areas where plastic isn’t just helpful; it’s essential. </p>
    <a href="https://www.acplasticsinc.com/informationcenter/r/medical-uses-for-plastic-materials" target="_blank">Plastic Uses</a>
    <p>3. Even though plastic can be expensive to dispose of and manage, it still plays a huge role in the economy by providing jobs and generating revenue. Plastic products are used every day, which makes them super-efficient to buy and sell for consumers. One of the biggest markets for plastic is packaging. When plastic came along, it changed everything. People went from using reusable containers to single-use ones, which made life easier and more convenient for consumers. Because of this shift, plastic waste has gone up a lot, from less than 1% of total waste in 1960 to over 10% by 2005 in many middle- and high-income countries.</p>

    <h3>Rebuttals</h3>
    <p>1. Using alternative sources might lessen the agricultural resources, but being creative in using natural materials could greatly improve our ecosystem. Sometimes we just have to sacrifice a small thing, and it would save the overwhelming problem of plastic waste. An example that uses a resource that is very easy to farm and also cheaper than plastic is seaweed. Using seaweed, people can create an alternative way to drink water from plastic bottles. Instead of using plastic to store water, seaweed and plants are used to create edible water bottles that can mimic the use of plastic bottles, with them also being completely tasteless and safe to consume. Not only could it safely decompose naturally in nature without leaving any toxins from the ecosystem, but it can also be convenient because of its edible nature and easy accessibility of the material. </p>
    <p>2. Exposure to plastic creates health problems. Because of the easy access to plastic, people are easily getting health problems that lead to more problems in using plastic. With the implementation of banning the manufacturing of plastic products, people are more likely to be healthier having to lessen their visits to the hospital. With less plastic pollution, the ecosystem creates a healthier environment for the population. We can decrease the total demand for plastic, limit the harm to the environment, and promote the development of sustainable alternatives by removing plastic. This strategy creates a balance between a greater commitment to environmental responsibility and the important role that plastic plays in important sectors like healthcare.</p>
    <p>3. Plastic can also create more job opportunities, as being experimenting and creative in using other materials can create a community where it can make campaigns that encourage the lifestyle of a cleaner and healthier ecosystem. As people, we have to think of ways where using alternative plastic materials would greatly benefit our finances and could change the world for the better.</p>

    <h4>Plastics are too useful</h4>
    <p>Plastics have revolutionized nearly every aspect of everybody's lives, offering unmatched versatility, durability, and cost-effectiveness that make them indispensable across many industries. From healthcare, food packaging, automotive and construction industries, the adaptability of plastics has led to its widespread use on our everyday lives.</p>
    <p>Take in healthcare as an example, plastics are used in many of the devices, equipments and instruments that they use. Syringes, IV bags, catherers, feeding tubes, contact lenses, they all use plastics. Their lightweight, sterility, and flexibility make them ideal for medical applications</p>
    <p> In food packaging, plastics are very helpful in preserving food by providing airtight, durable, and lightweight packaging. They help reduce food waste by extending shelf life and maintaining product safety during transport. Studies show that the use of plastic in food packaging, increases shelf life of food significantly. Take cucumbers as an example, unpackaged cucumbers take 3 days before it spoil, but plastic-wrapped cucumbers last 11 days longer. While bananas, compared to their unwrapped counterpart, last about 21 days longer. In an interview about the use of plastic in food packaging, Crispian Lao, the head of PARMS (Philippine Alliance for Recycling and Materials Sustainability), stated that no other material is as effective in the safe transportation of food. Especially in an archipelagic country like the Philippines, where food has to be transported between one island to another.</p>

    <h4>There are no viable alternatives</h4>
    <p>While there are substitutes available for certain applications of plastic products, many of them face significant challenges that make them less practical or even more environmentally harmful in other ways. Some alternatives to plastics produce a higher environmental footprint, things such as glass, metals and paper often come with higher environmental cost in terms of energy use and emissions. Manufacturing glass involves melting raw materials at very high temperatures, which contributes to higher carbon emissions. Additionally, transportation costs for such heavyweight material increases as much as the emissions. While metal containers are highly durable and recyclable, producing metals is resource-intensive. Manufacturing metal products require mining for the said metals and steel, generating pollution and contributing to deforestation. Moreover, as said before, the more heavyweight the material, the higher the energy required for processing of the material, which is the same for both glass and metals. The most popular alternative, paper, particularly in packaging, involves significant deforestation and chemical processing, leading to a higher environmental costs in terms of carbon emissions and habitat loss. Paper also requires extensive water resources for production and creates substantial waste in form of pulp and sludge, further polluting our bodies of water with improper waste management. </p>
    <p>These alternatives are more expensive to produce, which makes them unfeasible economically for widespread use, especially in a stale but still-developing country like ours. Imagine all packaging being aluminum boxes or cans as opposed to plastic bags, comparing production costs between the two would be day and night. A plastic bag costs less than a peso to produce, while an aluminum alternative with the same function would increase the cost by about 2000% minimum. Additionally, many cannot perform as well as plastics, especially in applications where the specific properties of plastics are utilized, such as its flexibility, durability, and resistance to moisture or chemicals. Paper or biodegradable packaging cannot offer the same moisture and chemical barriers, leading to increase food spoilage, which in turn just contributes to food waste -- a significant environmental problem in itself. Single-use medical devices cannot be substituted with a different material besides plastic. Other materials cannot meet the same hygiene standards or sterility that plastics provide. In Construction and Automotive industries, plastic materials provide unmatched strength, flexibility, durability and resistance to weather or chemicals. Alternatives like wood or metal cannot offer the same level of practicality in many of the needed applications in those industries.</p>
    <p>A focus on alternative materials caused by an outright ban on plastic manufacturing will lead to unintended consequences, many of which are what we are aiming to solve with that proposition. Things such as increased environmental degradation and waste disposal problems.</p>

    <h4>A ban on plastic manufacturing would lead to severe economic consequences</h4>
    <p>An outright ban on plastic manufacturing could lead to severe economic consequences. A ban would disrupt a lot of industries, leading to job losses and imposing financial burdens on businesses and consumers alike. Plastic manufacturing plays a significant role in the Philippine economy, contributing to various sectors. The Philippine plastic market is projected to reach approximately USD 6.8 billion, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 4.9%. In 2016, the country was the largest importer of plastic resins in Southeast Asia, with total imports amounting to 845 thousand tons. The plastic industry is vital to the national economy of the Philppines, a ban would entail a massive loss from the national GDP. The plastic manufacturing industry supports millions of jobs worldwide, from production to distribution. Banning plastic would lead to mass layoffs, directly impacting blue-collar workers in factories, suppliers and other related industries such as packaging and retail. It's a generative industry for CAMANAVA area of Metro Manila, as well as the provinces of Iloilo and Cebu. These cities house a lot of plastic manufacturing factories, providing jobs to the local population and contributing to the gross income of each municipality. The Philippine plastics industry is part of the regional and global supply chain, particularly in manufacturing packaging and parts for other countries. In 2022, the plastics industry of the Philippines was responsible for up to USD 895.4 million of exports. </p>
    <p>A ban would force the population to rely on alternatives to plastics. Replacing plastic with alternative material would drive up production costs, particularly for industries that rely on plastic's affordability and versatility. These increased costs would likely be passed on to consumers, leading to higher prices for every goods. Many small and medium-sized businesses in the Philippines rely on affordable plastic products for packaging and shipping. A ban would impose a financial strain on these businesses, potentially leading to closures, and further economic decline. Plastics are affordable and accessible, making them essential for low-income populations. They are used in affordable packaging and basic goods. Banning would limit access to affordable products for lower-income communities. A lot of poverty-stricken individuals are only able to afford small-use products, often packaged in sachets. Driving up the prices of these products would mean death for some of the population.</p>

    <div class="counterarguments">
    <h3>Counterarguments</h3>
    <p>1. In regards to plastic being useful, they might emphasize the environmental impact that plastics bring in a global scale. Such as, plastics take hundreds of years to decompose, leading to long-term environmental pollution, killing marine life, and contributing to contamination in different sectors which endangers human health. Oftentimes, plastics contain harmful chemicals which might leak into food and water when used in that specific manner, posing health risks to humans. Additionally, they might propose the use of alternatives centering around sustainable materials. Biodegradable options are increasingly able to match the usefulness of plastics in different fields. </p>
    <p>2. They might debunk the whole argument regarding alternatives not being viable. Truth of the matter is, there's a constant study being conducted on alternative materials over plastics. Alternatives do exist, but some may currently have a higher environmental impact. This might make them suggest that with proper investment and support from government and investors alike, they can make an alternative with less environmental impact and more use than plastic.</p>
    <p>3. A small sacrifice in the economic sector would lead to better yield in the long term. By gradually reducing plastic production, the Philippines could diversify into more sustainable industries, such as sustainable materials, renewable energy and green technology</p>
    <p>While a ban on plastic manufacturing may initially impact jobs in the plastic industry, it could simultaneously create job opportunities in new, sustainable sectors. Transitioning to biodegradable materials, recycling and other eco-friendly industries can generate employment for initially affected workers.</p>
    <p>And such, this may increase investment opportunities from private sectors worldwide. A ban as much as it could deter already existing investors, a fresh opportunity may attract new investors interested in eco-friendly initiatives, boosting economic growth. </p>
    <p>They might propose a solution regarding how the government could introduce subsidies or incentives for businesses that will adopt the shift to these new technologies. Additionally, they can say that in the long term, with products that are designed to be reused and recycled, it would help reduce the dependence on single-use plastics, creating a circular economy which in the long-term may save more economically by reducing expenses associated to plastic disposal.</p>

    <div class="rebuttals">
    <h3>Rebuttals</h3>
    <p>1. While plastics have significant environmental impact, banning them without viable, sustainable alternatives may lead to greater harm. Many plastic alternatives, such as glass and metal, have higher carbon footprints in terms of production, transportation, and recycling due to their weight and energy-intensive manufacturing process. A study from the Journal of Industrial Ecology highlights that alternatives like glass and metal can have significantly higher life cycle environmental costs when factors like production and transportation are considered. Studies show that the environmental impact of a signle-use glass bottle surpasses that of plastics and aluminum cans significantly. The transformation of raw materials into glass is energy-intensive, requiring high temperatures that result in CO2 emissions. Additionally, the substantial weight of glass, compared to plastic, exacerbates its environmental impact by increasing emissions further during transportation. In comparison, a glass bottle can weigh up to 800g, while a similar-sized plastic bottle weighs a mere 40g, a 95% difference. </p>
    <p>Currently, the Philippines enacted the EPR law in 2023, requiring companies to collect and process an equivalent amount of plastic waste to what they put on the market. We should aim to make producers to take even more responsibility for their use of plastic products, from production to disposal. This will encourage them to design packaging that is easier to recycle, reduce the use of unnecessary plastics, and fund waste management intiatives. Additionally, investing in building and upgrading recycling facilities, particularly for plastic materials would greatly reduce environmental pollution. Establishing a partnership between the government and private sector to raise investment would improve waste collection and recycling rates. Countries like Japan and Germany have invested heavily in recycling infrastructure, resulting in higher recycling rates and less plastic waste leakage. A well-developed recycling system can process large amounts of plastic waste, creating a circular economy where plastics are continuously reused, greatly reducing plastic waste.</p>

    <a href="https://waster.com.au/recycling-in-the-philippines/" target="_blank">Recycling in the Philippines</a>
    <p>2. Although there is ongoing research into alternative mateirals, many options currently lack the durability, versatility, and functionality that plastic offers. Plastic's lightweight, water-resistant, and moldable properties make it uniquely suited for a vast range of applications, from medical supplies to food packaging. Alternatives like paper, glass, and metal do not offer the same flexibility or efficiency for certain uses. For instance, paper may not provide adequate protection from moisture, while metal and glass are often too heavy and rigid. Taking just food packaging as an example, plastic helps extend shelf life significantly, and help reduces food waste due to its barrier properties, preventing spoilage. Alternatives like biodegradable materials or paper often fail to provide the same lengthy protection, which could lead to increased food waste. Food waste itself has a significant environmental impact, including greenhouse gas emissions from decomposing waste. </p>
    <p>Rather than an outright switch to alternatives, which may not be viable at scale, and presents a plethora of challenges, the focus should be on reducing single-use plastic items where feasible, and improving recycling infrastructure. The country's waste management and recycling infrastructure is underdeveloped at its core, this means switching to alternative materials pose even more challenges regarding the capability of processing them. For instance, biodegradable plastics require specific composting conditions not widely available in the Philippines. Without the necessary infrastructure, these alternatives may not degrade as intended, leading to continued environmental pollution. A rapid transition could disrupt existing systems without providing viable replacements</p>

    <p>3. Unrealistic economic transition Transitioning to sustainable industries sounds beneficial in theory, but the practical implementation of this shift would take years or even decades. The plastic manufacturing sector is deeply embedded in the Philippine economy, providing thousands of jobs and supporting other industries like food, healthcare, and retail. A sudden reduction or ban on plastic production could lead to immediate job losses and economic disruption, with no guaranteed timeline for replacements during this gap. Other developing countries have tried similar transitions, such as India with its SUP(Single-use Plastic) bans, but this has proven to be an extremely difficult task due to the limited alternatives and lack of infrastructure to support new materials. The Philippines could face similar disruptions.</p>
    <p>While creating a circular economy is an admirable goal, it's unrealistic to expect the Philippines to achieve this model, given the current state of politics, recycling infrastructure and waste management. Reducing plastic production and transitioning to sustainable industries are good goals, but the argument underestimates the complexity, cost, and timeline required to make this shift. A more balanced and realistic approach would involve improving the current existing systems, and introducing more schemes to make plastic waste management as seamless as possible, while gradually increasing support for alternative industries without risking economic instability.</p>
