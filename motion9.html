    <h4>It's good for the environment </h4>
    <p>Planting trees must be a prerequisite for graduation. Planting a tree after graduation can make a positive impact for the environment in more ways than one. One of the most significant benefits trees offer in our environment is their role in combating climate change all across the globe. Trees are able to absorb carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas into their system, through photosynthesis. This is important as the mass amount of carbon dioxide around the world is increasing the temperature of our planet thus causing climate change. Climate change has become one of the single biggest health threats facing humanity as a whole. Climate change is already directly harming health through pollution, diseases, drastic weather events, forced displacement, and poor nutrition where people are not able to grow sufficient food. By planting trees, students can offset their own carbon footprint and contribute to global efforts to reduce the effects of climate change.</p>
    <p>Trees also serve as protection by preventing soil erosion. The root systems of the trees anchor the soil place which reduces the risk of erosion in areas prone to heavy rainfall or on slopes which is especially prominent in the philippines. This helps maintain soil fertility which is critical for agriculture and prevents landslides from occurring. Additionally, trees serve as an important role in managing water resources. Their roots can absorb excess water, reducing surface runoff and helping to prevent flooding which is also prevalent in the philippines. Thus, this also helps replenish groundwater supplies, improving overall water quality and conservation efforts. Moreover, trees also support biodiversity by providing natural habitats for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, insects, and small mammals. When students plant trees, they can help create or restore ecosystems that offer shelter and food for these species which then contributes to the preservation of biodiversity. Planting trees after graduation contributes to a greener, more sustainable world. Planting trees should be a prerequisite for graduation as It is a gesture that can have lasting environmental benefits for the whole planet.</p>

    <h4>To leave an impactful legacy behind before graduation</h4>
    <p>Planting trees being a prerequisite for graduation is a must as it allows students to leave an impactful legacy behind before graduation. Leaving a powerful legacy by planting trees can symbolize both personal growth and environmental awareness. One of the most important ways this act creates a legacy is by providing a living symbol of the student’s own growth and achievements. Just as the student has developed throughout their academic journey in school, the tree also grows, gaining resilience and strength over time. As the tree matures, the tree becomes a physical manifestation of the student’s life and progress, reminding them of the milestones they’ve passed and the challenges they’ve overcome. Additionally, planting a tree reflects the student’s commitment to future generations. In this way, the act of planting just a single tree becomes a contribution to the world that outlasts the student’s own lifetime, allowing them to leave a legacy that extends beyond their current generation. The tree becomes more than just a planted seed–it is a testament to their dedication to the planet and the causes they care about. Over time, it serves a student’s personal marker of their beliefs, encouraging reflection on their responsibility to the world around them. </p>
    <p>The legacy of planting a tree can also extend to inspire others to do the same. A student’s act of planting a tree may encourage their friends, family, or even their community to take similar steps towards a better and more sustainable future. As more and more people see the tree and learn about its true significance, the idea of planting trees and caring for our planet can spread, essentially creating a ripple effect of positive change. In this way, the student’s legacy is not confined to their own action but can inspire the broader community involved for environmental conservation.</p>
    <p>To conclude, planting a tree after graduation is a meaningful way for students to leave a lasting legacy. It symbolizes personal growth, environmental responsibility, and commitment to the future. Through the years, the tree will only continue to grow, inspire others, and provide long-term benefits to the planet as a whole thus becoming a living testament to the student’s positive impact on the world.</p>

    <h4>Reduces air pollution/Gives more oxygen</h4>
    <p>Planting trees after graduation must be implemented as it can play a significant role in reducing air pollution in both immediate and long-term ways. One of the primary benefits trees offer is their ability to absorb carbon dioxide through the use of photosynthesis. Trees take carbon dioxide from the air and convert it into oxygen which is then released back into the atmosphere. By planting trees, students directly contribute to reducing concentrations of carbon dioxide helping to control its harmful effects on the environment and reduce the overall greenhouse effect. Additionally, trees are effective at filtering out other harmful pollutants from the air. These pollutants include sulfur dioxide, ammonia, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, all of these are common byproducts of industrial activities, vehicle emissions, and power generation. Trees act as natural air filters, absorbing these harmful substances into their leaves, bark, and roots. This process helps improve air quality, making the environment healthier for people, animals and plant life in the surrounding area. </p>
    <p>Furthermore, trees can improve air circulation in urban environments. When trees are planted in clusters or along green corridors, trees help to create airflow that disperses pollutants, preventing them from accumulating in one area– the natural ventilation helps lower the concentration of harmful air substances, therefore improving overall air quality. By encouraging students to plant trees before graduation, they will be promoting a cleaner and fresher air in neighborhoods and cities, especially those with high levels of industrial activity and traffic pollution like Makati.</p>
    <p> In conclusion, planting a tree after graduation is a simple but effective way for students to help reduce air pollution. Through absorbing carbon dioxide and other pollutants, cooling urban environments, and providing long-term environmental benefits, trees play a critical role in improving air quality. By planting a tree, students not only contribute to cleaner air, but also inspire others to take action, creating a lasting legacy of environmental care and responsibility.</p>

    <h3>Counterarguments</h3>
    <p>1. While planting trees is good for the environment, simply planting a tree does not guarantee it will survive or contribute meaningfully to the ecosystem. Trees require consistent care, especially in their early stages, to ensure survival and growth. Many students may not have the resources, knowledge, or ability to provide ongoing care, which may result in high mortality rates for the planted trees. Poorly managed tree-planting intitiatives can lead to wasted resources without lasting benefits. A study published in Environmental Science and Pollution Research emphasizes the importance of enhancing and securing permanence of carbon stored in trees and soils, noting that poorly managed tree planting could negatively impact global warming efforts.</p>
    <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10311-023-01598-y" target="_blank">Planting trees to combat global warming</a>
    <p>2. The act of planting a tree may be symbolic, but it is meaningless if not followed up by constant care and bigger actions. Focusing on tree planting as a graduation requirement could lead to a mentality that forces students to just do the task without any further thought, not understanding the true meaning of the task. Additionally, requiring students to participate in a specific legacy building activity might infringe on their personal freedom to choose how they wish to leave a mark for the school community. There are many other passions that students can leave their own mark in, may it be through arts, academics or sports. Mandating tree planting as a requirement for graduation could limit the potential of a student to explore other fields of interest. </p>
    <p>3. While tree planting could help reduce air pollution, there are other impactful ways for students to contribute to sustainability that may be more accessible or align better with their capabilities. For instance, organizing recycling programs, advocating for environmental laws, volunteer cleanup efforts may be a more accessible and less risky tasks. Planting trees without proper planning can sometimes harm local ecosystems. If a non-native or invasive tree species are planted, they may disrupt local biodiversity and kill the native species. An indiscriminate tree planting requirement might inadvertently contribute to ecological imbalances.</p>

    <h3>Rebuttals</h3>
    <p>1. While it's true that poorly managed projects might fail, a structured and well-supervised tree-planting requirement can ensure success. Schools could start with a limited number of trees, choosing carefully the species that require minimal care and is not invasive to the current ecosystem. The school can also tap into the community, and find people who are knowledgeable and can help care for the trees in the long term. Engaging students in tree planting fosters environmental awareness and personal connection to nature. This type of activity culminates a thoughtful mentality for participating students in the long term. The Department of Education's "School Inside a Garden" program encourages schools to create gardens and green spaces, providing students with hands-on experiences in caring for plants and understanding ecological systems. This type of effort would help round up the school community and help better the environment for everyone.</p>

    <p>2. It is true that some students might think of tree planting just as a mere project for graduating, the responsibility of teachers and schools is to ensure that the students understand its significance. Integrating environmental education with tree planting activities ensure that students grasp the significance of ecological stewardship. The Department of Education emphasizes the importance of environmental education in schools, aiming to instill a deeper understanding and commitment to sustainable practices to students. The "One Child, One Tree" initiative in Hagonoy, Bulacan, encourages students to plant trees, fostering a sense of responsibility and motivating them to participate in larger environmental actions. Planting trees allows students to leave a lasting, positive impact on their local environment. The Haribon Foundation's "Forests for Life" movement involves schools and communities in reforestation activities, enabiling students to contribute to the restoration of Philippine rainforests and witness the long-term benefits of their efforts.</p>

    <p>3. Recycling, advocacy, and cleanups are valuable activities that benefit the environment, but they address specific environmental issues separately. Tree planting, however, contributes to a broad range of environmental benefits simultaneously, such as improving air quality, reducing soil erosion, enhancing biodiversity, and sequestering carbon. Rather than choosing one over the other, we can use each and every one to complement one another to have a bigger lasting impact to the environment. The Haribon Foundation advocates for tree planting as a means to restore degraded ecosystems while complementing other conservation efforts in the Philippines. While it is true that improper tree planting can harm ecosystems, schools can partner with environmental organizations to ensure proper planning. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources and local NGOs offer guidance on planning effective tree planting projects. The National Greening Program has successfully implement large-scale planting projects across the Philippines by prioritizing native species.</p>

    <h4>Impractical</h4>
    <p>Although currently we have an issue of lacking of trees due to extreme deforestation. The plan to plant trees as a pre requisite for graduation for ALL graduating students is impractical and would waste resources, time, funds, and space. </p>
    <p>Tree planting, for students all over the country is noble, but will there be the same amount of people who will try to nurture or make sure that the seeds which were planted grow properly? Not checking if those plants survive in the long run will put the activities to naught and resources to waste. The Department of Agriculture's willingness to help in checking in the progress, and supplying the seeds is a good help. But can that accommodation be able to handle hundreds and thousands of schools? Let alone the fact that of course, this project will not be happening for free. Considering the amount of funds needed, in which the government and stakeholders will invest in this. Such risky measure cannot guarantee a better of ratio success.</p>
    <p>According to Alejano, 525 million more trees would be planted nationwide even if the trees' survival rate was only 10%. Statistically speaking, that 90% aforementioned being wasted is a more leading to a higher waste of resources and funds. One can't guarantee that 525million trees are guaranteed, as it is only done by speculation with no solid ground. </p>
    <p>Planting trees as a climate solution has numerous advantages, but it also has some drawbacks. Planting trees can only partially offset the annual carbon emissions caused by human activity. Additionally, trees that are lost as a result of pest outbreaks, land conversion, fires, droughts, and floods can release carbon. Karen Holl, a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, stated that "as temperatures rise and precipitation patterns change, large areas are becoming unsuitable habitat for trees due to direct water stress and indirectly through fires and insect outbreaks." </p>

    <h4>Better leave it to nature</h4>
    <p>This ambitious project is too much and can overwhelm the lands and the trees that grow themselves in this amount. The apparent is that forestry has always depended on planting trees. However, some restoration ecologists have criticized this strategy, claiming that planting and caring for young trees is costly and wasteful of limited resources. They also point out that if plantations are cut and used to make short-lived wood products like paper or cardboard, the carbon stored in growing trees is swiftly released into the sky.</p>
    <p>In few well-researched case studies, planting trees has even had unfavorable results. For example, the expansion of forest cover in China's Loess Plateau led to increased soil erosion and decreased water availability for agriculture and human use. Subsidies for tree planting in Chile produced a twisted incentive to plant trees rather than preserve natural forests. There was no net change in the amount of carbon stored in trees nationwide during the 2006–2011 period, and the strategy caused a loss of natural forest cover. </p>
    <p>There is ample proof that spontaneous regeneration has been successful in accelerating the restoration of biodiversity and forest biomass. Natural regeneration is sometimes seen as a solution that benefits both the environment and economic growth. </p>
    <p>The results of a 20-year study that attempted to answer this topic were just published. A multinational team evaluated the amount of carbon contained in the remaining trees in a Malaysian tropical forest that had been cleared for logging in the 1980s and 1990s. After that, the amount of carbon monitored retained over a 20-year period in both naturally regenerating areas and nearby patches that had been extensively restored by planting trees and removing climbers and other invasive plants. Comparing the two, it was discovered that the forest that was being actively restored was storing carbon 50% more quickly than the forest that was being allowed to naturally regenerate. Without the need of human interference, forests were able to properly adjust and regenerate themselves on their own. Much more effective and no need for us to intervene. No cost at all, just keep it safe growing on its own.</p>

    <h4>Not solving the Core issues</h4>
    <p> Illegal logging are the main core issues why such problem exists in the philippines for years, even if we do plant millions of trees, if we don't protect the rainforests from such human activities then deforestation and will kill off the remaining rainforests before even the recovery could make its comeback. Not only are we directing our efforts on risky solutions, we are still letting illegal logging off and not being strict enough with our laws. </p>
    <p>Forest conversion to agriculture is another issue facing the Philippines. Forest conversion for agriculture has expanded in the Philippines due to the country's fast expanding population and the need to feed its people. Unfortunately, slash-and-burn agriculture and other unsustainable farming methods are frequently the result of this conversion, which adds to the deforestation problem.</p>
    <p>The Philippines must address issues like poverty and a lack of alternate sources of income for local populations, which are the main drivers of deforestation. To lessen the strain on forests and encourage sustainable land-use practices, alternative livelihood opportunities including eco-tourism, agroforestry, and sustainable forestry can be offered.</p>
    <p>Numerous causes contribute to the persistence of illegal logging in the current day. First of all, the reason it can continue at the rate it does is a lack of law enforcement. In recent years, the Philippine government has increased its efforts to combat illegal logging, but they haven't been successful. For instance, in southern Palawan, an island in the western Philippines, indigenous people saw trees that had been unlawfully destroyed within a mining concession at the beginning of November 2020. At least twice a month, Simpio Mata, the chief of the Pala'wan indigenous group, trudges through the Mount Domadoway natural forest in the southern Philippines' Palawan region. Mata, 42, said that he has recently been horrified by the sight of fallen trees. </p>
    <p>Mata claims that the illegal logging is not the only thing that worries the locals; they are also concerned that the activities may indicate a return to mining operations, which the Pala'wan have been opposing for decades. If we let such operations continue around the nation. Then history will repeat itself.</p>

    <h3>Counterarguments</h3>
    <p>1. Its an alternative measure for the environment  It has feasible results and deforestation made Indigenous tribes uprooted from their lands, soil erosion occurred, and streams became poisoned as a result of these trees' removal. Indigenous groups lose the productivity of their land, biodiversity declines, and plant and animal species become extinct as more forests are lost.  Such illegal logging and burning has been fought back by the government for several years as well and has enforced stricter rules. It has worked throughout the years but it is not something we can't guarantee to fully be able to take out because many people who are in need of money to sustain their lives will continue to try and do it illegally somewhere in the nation. Corruption and rural poverty are the main causes of illegal logging. Of course the Government's action in dealing with illegal logging and mining will still continue on while having this solution at hand to take place.</p>

    <p>2. Plantation is very much faster  According to studies, letting it leave to reforestations can take up to decades and centuries to properly grow back the greenery and fertility of lost lands. Plantation will take much faster when it comes to growing them with the help of several planting techniques that humans have learned throughout the years.</p>

    <h3>Rebuttals</h3>
    <p>1. We are aware of how vital forests are to ecosystem services, biodiversity, water, and climate. According to this study, reforestation's ability to mitigate climate change diminishes dramatically at higher latitudes unless it is combined with considerable emission reductions that lower air pollution. To add to that if we keep on forcing on planting too many trees, it will start having competition with each other under the roots which will make the </p>

    <p>2. Students are the ones involved, not experts Even with the right techniques, can we guarantee that students are able to execute the plantation properly in a way that it will not die? Even with the back up of officials and experts to see and nurture the plants, if the process of trying to plant it is bad, then it could affect the whole growing process. To add to that, it was not mentioned that students will undergo a small lesson or training on how it will be done. With the large scale of students planting trees, the assistance won't be for free right?</p>
