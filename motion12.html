    <h4>13th largest rice exporter in the world</h4>
    <p>Philippines as of 2022 We are the 13th largest rice exporter in the world which is one of the countries bigger expenses specifically 1.6 Billion dollars while only making 1.4 million in exports ranking us in 561th place out of 1127. This means that The philippines is spending at least 93 Billion pesos on rice when those funds could be allocated to other aspects of our country such as healthcare and education and could instead be invested into making our rice productions self sustaining to not only reduce costs but eventually we could also increase our rice exports so that the country can make a profit rather than a significant financial loss to the country. </p>

    <h4>Second most grown crop</h4>
    <p> Palay, also known as Rice, is the 2nd most grown crop in philippine agriculture yet we consume more than we can produce which has been increasing even more as the philippine population continues to further increase the philippines is not able to keep up because of crop losses due to weather such as dry season and poor irrigation or seasonal typhoons that cause significant damage. improving our rice production by increasing crop survival by making them more resistant and increasing yield through genetic modification to further optimize the already existing rice fields while increasing worker pay to increase farmer morale would help provide more opportunities for work in the agriculture profession </p>

    <h4>Important product</h4>
    <p>Rice is an important agricultural product in the philippine culture. We have different words in the Filipino language to translate the different states and forms of rice such as palay, bigas, kanin bahaw etc, rice is in our breakfast lunch and dinner in the dishes like champorado suman puto fried rice. Rice is so important to the filipino culture a huge margin of filipino dishes will involve or contain rice in it. that the cost of rice is heavily ingrained into politics that people will react and protest if the prices increased by a significant amount., therefore it would be better if we find a way to cultivate our own rice to make our culture self-sustaining for our people and become rice self sufficient.</p>

    <h3>Counterarguments</h3>
    <p>1. While yes the country may struggle to keep up currently with the production of rice, importing rice to solve it is not an ideal long term solution as even the top exporters are struggling to keep producing rice, for the sake of long term food security instead of investing money into buying imported rice we should start investing the money into producing more rice as the rice shortage world wide increases there will be less rice available for export so it is best we look towards producing our own rice in order to make our rice self sustaining as other countries are already looking for potential solutions why shouldnt the philipines do the same? especially since the current deal of rice between the philipines and vietnam is only 5 years long </p>
    <p>2. There is enough fertile land due to the fact that rice terraces are being abandoned due to the fact that people that live in these terraces have to move to find better work and opportunities which causes these historical and cultural landscapes to slowly errode their irrigation systems and become overgrown with wildlife undoing the centuries of work done on these terraces, the money that gets spend on importing rice here to the philipines couldve been spent on revitalizing these historial and effecient rice fields so that our local and indigenous people dont have to lose their homes and be displaced. </p>
    <p>3. There are ways to make rice typhoon and flood resistant one of the methods to making resilient rice farming is by creating rice varieties through cultivation that are more tolerant of the harsh conditions that cause crop loss and therefore reduce rice yields this also promotes biodiversity within rice which helps better fight against other threats such as threats and plant diseases, making a push towards agroecology will help promote the cultivation of more resilient rice and crop variaties. an ancient example of agroecology is our national rice terraces that have their own irrigation system to help keep the rice irrigated reducing the chances of rice drying out. </p>

    <h3>Rebuttals</h3>
    <p>1. There are other ways apart from breeding new rice varieties GMOs can also assist in creating a new type of rice that is both resilient and still produces high yield although these will still require testing it is still a much better long term solution than relying on importation of rice as there that may be limited as again we only have a 5 year contract with vietnam to give us rice if the other countries start struggling as well that means that the supply has to be spread out which means there may be a shortage in our own country even WITH importation. </p>
    <p>2. Yes we must spend on rice but rather than spending around 1 billion dollars a year in importing rice we can invest that money into our own agriculture as this wont benefit just rice but other crops that we grow as well such as sugar cane which is the 1st most grown crop in the philipines. Not to mention that as inflation continues to be a problem the prices to import rice will keep increasing alongside the population. It is much better to invest the money into our own agriculture to combat this as itll help secure our future supply of rice. </p>
    <p>3. We do not produce enough rice because the government does not invest in agriculture or its farmers compared to the money spent in the importation of rice. there is a current 10 year plan that costs 2.5 trillion in total however despite the costs it will be worth it as the investments we make now will help the future generations as we don't know what will happen in the future and we don't know bad inflation prices will be in the next 10 years which will impact rice importation prices. </p>

    <h3>Arguments</h3>

    <h4>Rice is a staple food</h4>
    <p>Statista states that Filipinos have consumed about 16 million metric tons of rice in the marketing year of 2022/2023. However, the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service has stated that the Philippines has only produced 12.63 million metric tons of rice in 2022/2023. Philrice also supports this. This is troubling because the population of the Philippines will only increase as the years pass. As stated before, the production of rice in the span of one year has been significantly less than the rate of consumption for that same year. As the population grows, the demand for rice will grow in tandem. However, with the local production of rice falling behind by such a significant amount, it alone will not be able to satisfy the needs of the Filipino people. With local production not being able to satisfy demand compared to supply, we must rely on importation in order to feed our people.</p>

    <a href="https://www.philrice.gov.ph/ricelytics/supplies/" target="_blank">Supply and Utilization</a>

    <h4>Lack of fertile land</h4>
    <p>Some reasons why the Philippines cannot satisfy the demand of rice via the means of local production is due to the fact we do not have enough fertile land to cultivate crops due to a lack of river deltas, unlike Vietnam, which has an advantageous geography (The Red River Delta and Mekong Delta) to produce plenty of crops. Another reason is that we are falling behind on agricultural technology. Compared to Vietnam, who have employed various means to increase the cost-effectiveness of their rice production, the Philippines have been left behind in terms of mechanization and modernization.</p>

    <h4>Subject to natural disasters</h4>
    <p>The third and damndest reason as to why we must allow the importation of rice into the Philippines is that we are very often subject to unpredictable weather phenomena and natural disasters that can spell calamity for our farms. These can range from typhoons, to floods, as well as droughts. These phenomena, exacerbated by global warming, cause our farms to flood, or dry up, and simply ultimately become destroyed and unusable with crops wasted. Since we cannot control the weather, our agricultural efforts will continue to be negatively affected by these weather conditions. The significant destruction and loss of crops are an incentive for us to import rice from other countries, as if we were to deny importation, it would be impossible for us to make up the difference with the remaining crops that we have. Such reasons are why the importation of rice is something we require in the Philippines. Merely relying on our own means of production would only cause us to fall into hunger as crop yields would be insufficient for our large population’s dependence on rice. </p>

    <div class="counterarguments">
    <h3>Counterarguments</h3>
    <p>There are different varieties of genetically modified rice such as Sahod Ulan (which is more resistant to droughts) and Submarino 1 (which is more resistant to flooding) to name a few. These rice varieties can combat the destructive weather conditions within the Philippines. However, we still lose several crops in spite of these resilient rice varieties existing. This is because rice farmers use higher yielding varieties, and other flood-resistant varieties that are being cultivated right now have not been tested in real farms where they can experience the real, harsh conditions of nature. Since rice yields are still insufficient even though we have modified varieties, it is not enough to fulfill the needs of every filipino. </p>
    <p>We also must spend on rice as, like what was said before, local rice production isn’t enough to fill the bellies of the Filipino people. Our local rice yield has only grown from 8.7Mil metric tons to 12.9Mil metric tons from 2002 to 2022. Meanwhile, our rice consumption has increased from 8 Mil metric tons to 15~16 Mil metric tons from 2002 to 2022. Our rice consumption has grown nearly twice the amount in over 20 years and our local rice yield has been unable to keep up. Even if we invest into our agriculture to make our rice farms more self-sufficient, we still won’t be able to keep up in a long time, especially because of the growing population. Thus we need importation, even if we put our efforts towards self-sufficiency, because self-sufficiency won't catch up to the rate at which we consume rice.</p>

    <div class="rebuttals">
    <h3>Rebuttals</h3>
    <p>Creating new rice varieties can take years of experimenting. The Sub1 gene, which is responsible for letting rice survive underwater for 2 weeks, was discovered in 1991. The IR64 Sub1 (a.k.a Submarino 1), which contains the gene, was released throughout the Philippines 18 years later, in 2009. While creating new strains of rice that can survive the weather conditions of the Philippines would be good for our country’s self-sustainability, it would take several years. Years in which we do not have enough local rice to satisfy our people. With climate change getting worse as well, (a predicted temp increase of ~2C and a rainfall increase in Luzon and Visayas by 2050) weather patterns will change with storms becoming more destructive and droughts to increase, according to the UN. Weather changes could affect the effectiveness of our crops’ genetic modifications. With the Philippines’ geographical location making us more vulnerable to these destructive weather patterns as well as the cultivation of resistant rice strains taking years, the Philippines’ local rice production is likely to suffer from shortages in the coming years. This is also coupled with the fact that we still suffer rice shortages even with the strains we currently use. </p>
    <p>While there are rice terraces that have been abandoned and can/have been re-cultivated in order to help with our agricultural efforts, there’s a gap within our local rice production that can’t be filled within a short time. According to the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service, Vietnam’s rice yield is over twice ours. While our local rice production is still not enough, importation can fill the gaps in our supply. </p>
    <p>Aside from importation being a short-term solution to our current inadequate supply, it should still be allowed even if we are able to be self-sustained as we can fall victim to the adverse weather and phenomena in our country at any point. Importation can also serve the purpose of allowing a larger amount of different kinds of rice for people to choose. Rice importation can serve to fill the gaps in local rice shortages, loss in rice crops and damage to rice agriculture, as well as being able to make different rice grains more accessible. Overall, rice importation is still important even when self-sufficiency becomes a reality for the Philippines.</p>
