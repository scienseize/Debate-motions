    <h4>Filling necessary gaps in the Justice system</h4>
    <p>Being in the Philippines right now, it is no secret that there are many gaps in the Justice system, a lot of those gaps could be filled with vigilantism especially because our law enforcement is ineffective and undoubtedly corrupt. This can be crucial in situations where the wrongdoer had committed a time-sensitive crime, by how slow and unresponsive law enforcement may be, it is better if people can step up and protect their community. An article suggests that the treatment for sex offenders is too forgiving and being in a registry does not really stop them from being repeat offenders. With that the article reports that vigilantism is present against such crimes saying that in one US study, about 15% of respondents have been physically assaulted after being known as sex offenders. In this way it is more manageable to not only stop current offenders but also prevent future ones from commiting crimes by instilling that more than just the justice system have the ability to stop them. </p>

    <h4>Confidence will be given back to the Justice System</h4>
    <p>Justice Systems relinquishing some of its powers to the people may be a questionable move but given that it is for vigilantism, confidence for the justice system will be earned back through it. A lot of the time, people always have a preconception that the justice system is always unfair and geared towards the people who will give them the most money. If people know they can always do something about a certain issue or a prevalent threat, they will gain the confidence that they can always do something about it and not have to check if it is legal or not for the sake of vigilantism. A country that allows vigilantism is Finland and according to articles pertaining to the country, it is regarded as one of the safest to go to thus far. According to articles, the citizens of finland found their own country safe given that a lot of laws are in place to keep citizens and even tourists safe. That type of safety insurance is only found in countries that have no concerns about its justice system nor the people outside of it.</p>
      
    <h4>Marginalized communities get more protection</h4>
    <p>When a country ostracizes a group of individuals unlawfully, they could get protection in a form of vigilantism. Where there is political disagreement between the main state and its opposed communities, tensions rise between both parties and crime against these groups tend to be overlooked by the justice system. Systemic violence is a common threat to such especially in multicultural countries with racism still prevalent or sexist ideologies that vilify groups of gender. Legalizing Vigilante groups will allow the oppressed to have protection and get their voice to end the systemic violence done to them. One such example of this is the outcry of people after the George Floyd murder. Not only did the riots bring to light the systemic violence against the African American community, it also paved the way for other marginalized communities to fight back and have their voices heard from the abuse they experienced. One such article even recalls the time that vandals destroyed statues of slave traders and other abusive people in history all in the name of being heard and for George Floyd.</p>

    <h3>Counterarguments</h3>
    <p>1. The government is enough and responsible to fill its own gaps on its own justice system. With enough protests, we can have the government know that there are inadequacies pertaining to its legislative system and offer solutions to combat it’s corruption </p>
    <p>2. This may instead cause panic over the state of the justice system when it needs to rely on exterior powers to carry out the law. With Exterior powers being able to give verdict to people outside the legislative system, people may find themselves vulnerable to any accusation this external power may give. </p>
    <p>3. Under many cases, vigilantism actually targets more marginalized communities than not due to outside biases and other factors.</p>

    <p>1. But the government is not totally to be trusted to do such things and even now when they have all the power to fill in the gaps in their system, there is still a lot of that let corruption prevail. </p>
    <p>2. But movements like people power will be considered illegal and oppositions against abusive leadership will be outlawed.</p>
    <p>3. Then it is the government’s duty to legalize those who fight for marginalized communities. Multiple laws are in place to help protect women and children so why can’t the government have protection for those who are systematically violated against.</p>

    <h4>Promotes violence</h4>
    <p>Vigilante actions can escalate violence as they may provoke those targeted or create conflicts within the community. Vigilante violence might begin with hard tapping, slapping and punching. However it escalates to a more intense extralegal trial or in many cases, unauthorized execution. Therefore, the moral justification behind vigilantism may inadvertently inspire extremist behaviors and undermine the authority of the criminal justice system. In 1851 America, a committee of vigilantes was formed. They had established patrols against fire and theft and deported numerous undesirable persons. It asserted the right to search without a warrant and denied the right of fair trial with legal authorities. It was a group, notorious for hanging its captives after brief trials.</p>

    <h4>Provokes unlawful behavior</h4>
    <p>Some legal authorities engage in vigilantism. Not to mention extrajudicial killings or extrajudicial executions. For example, in the infamous campaign of former Philippine president Duterte’s “anti-drug war” made multiple calls on the public to kill drug addicts. These calls could constitute vigilante groups to commit unlawful violence and murder. Duterte has also repeatedly urged the Philippine National Police to target suspected drug users and drug dealers with extrajudicial violence, which could be considered instigating law enforcement to commit extralegal actions or murder leading to thousands of innocent deaths or “collateral damage”. Even promising that said personnels will be protected from any case filed. Back in 2020 Philippines, an incident recorded of the senseless killing of a mother and her son by an off-duty officer over noise complaints had caused an outrage throughout the whole of Philippines. Through this act, the government, Philippine National Police and specifically former president Duterte faced extreme criticism and accused for inciting groups of police and military to act in impunity.</p>

    <h4>Causes unwanted casualties</h4>
    <p>Vigilantes may target the wrong individuals or community, leading to wrongful accusations and assault which can further social injustice. Vigilantes often break the law in their efforts to punish alleged accused. Furthermore, self-initiated actions can lead to the escalation of conflicts. Retaliation is a common consequence when one group perceives itself as wronged or threatened. Such escalations can result in a cycle of violence, posing significant risks to public order and safety. Law enforcers are allowed to patrol on the ground as they undergo rigorous training so they may be able to competently apply legal practices to incidents they attend. Therefore, without any professional training, vigilantes may resort to lethal use of force which could do more harm to innocents and damage properties.</p>

    <h4> Poses more detrimental effects to legal authorities</h4>
    <p>Vigilantism occurs when people lose trust in the government to keep its side of the bargain. If citizens engage in vigilantism and believe they must enforce justice into their own hands, it reflects a lack of trust in law institutions, diminishing cooperation and public trust to authorized personnels. Vigilantes may interfere with ongoing investigations, which may compromise evidence and potentially undermine legal processes. Complicating the roles and responsibilities of law enforcements. Vigilante incidents tend to attract the media’s attention. If known vigilantes face prosecution, legal authorities may face backlash of negative publicity from some local and wider communities.</p>

    <h3>Counterarguments</h3>
    <p>1. They might propose establishing an organized citizens on patrol that could assist local law enforcement and maintain public order within a community. Such proposals are certainly welcomed by the community as they would ease the burden on police officers. However, legal authorities cannot be certain that the members of such a committee would adhere to the established guidelines and refrain from unlawful activities. Furthermore, even if that specific committee performs thorough background checks, members could easily omit or conceal their past misdemeanors or criminal behavior. As stated before, without appropriate protocols in place, some individuals may misuse their authority and assert that their actions comply with legal standards. When these situations arise, it is solely the government that will face criticism for being negligent in allowing these committees. </p>
    <p>2. They might also suggest that immediate action is required. Even when an event is happening directly in front of a person. It is common sense to seek assistance before intervening impulsively. Assessing the circumstances beforehand could minimize confusion. Otherwise, it leads to worsening the situation.</p>

    <h3>Rebuttals</h3>
    <p>One consequence of vigilantism is its potential escalation to anarchy. People resort to vigilantism when they lose faith in the legal system. This loss of faith often originates from perceptions of corruption, ineffectiveness, or an inability to address certain crimes. However, permitting vigilantism would only increase this distrust, as it would indicate that the state cannot effectively deliver justice on its own. When individuals believe they can no longer depend on established systems to safeguard their rights or hold wrongdoers accountable, they may take justice into their own hands which would further diminish confidence towards legal institutions. This situation could trigger a chain reaction effect that results in chaos over time. </p>
    <p>The legalization of vigilantism will raise significant moral and ethical concerns. The moral argument against vigilantism is based on the principle that justice must be served fairly, guided by reason and established principles rather than emotional impulses or personal biases. Vigilantes frequently act out of anger or in the belief of their own sense of righteousness which may cloud their judgment. In some instances, vigilantes may justify violent actions based on their individual moral codes. If society permits individuals to act according to their personal values, it risks encouraging an environment where personal values and interpretations of justice take priority over universally accepted legal principles. This ultimately undermines the core purpose of the legal system.</p>
